Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together. __eou__ Supposin' he don't go to the ranch? __eou__ I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch. __eou__ I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back. __eou__ Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear? __eou__ 
What is it, son? __eou__ Two more hogs got the fever. __eou__ 
Who's he? __eou__ Best we move that pig. __eou__ 
Hullo, paw. __eou__ I guess you lost some hogs to the fever. __eou__ Three. __eou__ Three? That ain't bad considerin'. __eou__ 
That fella come by... Tom. __eou__ Tom? __eou__ The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol... __eou__ The Kid, yeah... __eou__ Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time. __eou__ 
He say anythin'... The Kid... ? __eou__ Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was... __eou__ Well, I come back, didn't I? __eou__ 
Did you... did you... ? __eou__ Did I what? __eou__ All that money... I mean... did you...? __eou__ Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it. __eou__ No... I meant... __eou__ What? __eou__ K-k-kill somebody? __eou__ Who said that? __eou__ N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'... __eou__ Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more. __eou__ I guess you didn't kill nobody then. __eou__ Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody. __eou__ 
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow? __eou__ Thought you was followin' me. __eou__ 
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'... __eou__ I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella. __eou__ 
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent. __eou__ Nothin's bent. __eou__ Well, you was shootin' every which way an'... __eou__ You gonna share your half with him? __eou__ 
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass. __eou__ Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them. __eou__ 
You was right to change your mind, Kid. __eou__ Yeah? __eou__ I'm a damn good shot.  See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot. __eou__ 
Far enough. __eou__ We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards? __eou__ More. __eou__ See that scrub oak yonder? __eou__ Fuck you. __eou__ He's blind, for Chri... __eou__ I ain't blind, you asshole. __eou__ 
Say, Ned... ? __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer? __eou__ I don't like the question. __eou__ Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape. __eou__ How many you killed, Kid? __eou__ Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife. __eou__ 
Jesus.  You done this before? __eou__ Plenty of times. __eou__ 
His pistol must of jammed. __eou__ Move the candle closer, I can't see. __eou__ He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one. __eou__ 
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh? __eou__ He ain't as tough as you, Kid. __eou__ Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an... __eou__ Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window. __eou__ That was your idea, I wanted to... __eou__ 
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth... __eou__ Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow. __eou__ I don't kill nobody without him.  __eou__ We don't need him. The two of us could do it. __eou__ 
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean? __eou__ All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks. __eou__ We done that stuff. __eou__ Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said. __eou__ 
He's gonna die, ain't he? __eou__ Maybe. __eou__ Well, suppose he does? __eou__ We'll bury him. __eou__ That ain't what I mean. __eou__ You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys? __eou__ I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet. __eou__ An' if I spot 'em? __eou__ I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em! __eou__ Just like that? __eou__ I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him. __eou__ Yeah? __eou__ Hell, yeah. __eou__ 
Jack. What are you doing here? __eou__ I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor? __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they __eou__ 
There was ninety-one million - __eou__ We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it. __eou__ What was the money for? __eou__ He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive. __eou__ I don't get it. __eou__ They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze __eou__ Who ? __eou__ Bear with me here... __eou__ 
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     + __eou__ And ? __eou__ 
Keyser Soze __eou__ There's more. __eou__ 
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt; __eou__ He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something. __eou__ 
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people. __eou__ &lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt; __eou__ 
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt; __eou__ No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye. __eou__ 
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt; __eou__ He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes. __eou__ 
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt; __eou__ + The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt; __eou__ &lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt; __eou__ &lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt; __eou__ &lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt; __eou__ He says the hair is longer and lighter. __eou__ 
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude. __eou__ I'm having a stroke. __eou__ You've come far. You're a good man. I love you. __eou__ 
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning. __eou__ Just forget about it. __eou__ 
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday. __eou__ Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say? __eou__ They want more time to think about investing. __eou__ Goddamnit. __eou__ They just said they wanted time. __eou__ Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am. __eou__ 
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we - __eou__ No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished. __eou__ 
Don't give up on me now, Dean. __eou__ They'll never stop. __eou__ I love you. __eou__ They ruined me tonight. __eou__ Dean, I love you. Do you hear me? __eou__ 
Come home, Dean. __eou__ Alright. __eou__ 
That's enough, Edie. __eou__ I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it. __eou__ Edie, please. __eou__ 
I know who he is. __eou__ I hope I didn't disturb you. __eou__ I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink? __eou__ A glass of water would be nice. __eou__ 
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint? __eou__ Umm ... __eou__ A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative? __eou__ 
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus. __eou__ Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet . __eou__ 
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point. __eou__ This whole thing was a shakedown. __eou__ 
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that. __eou__ So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight? __eou__ It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do. __eou__ I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight. __eou__ 
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up. __eou__ I don't want to know. __eou__ 
This is not right. __eou__ I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York? __eou__ 
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth. __eou__ Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing . __eou__ I don't know. This is bad. __eou__ 
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal. __eou__ You are a criminal. __eou__ Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point. __eou__ 
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation. __eou__ Then who goes? __eou__ We all go. How about it, Keaton? __eou__ 
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS. __eou__ RIGHT THERE. FREEZE. __eou__ 
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with. __eou__ They fucking know everything. __eou__ 
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup. __eou__ The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity. __eou__ 
You heard right. __eou__ The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about? __eou__ 
He's alright. __eou__ How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story? __eou__ His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him. __eou__ 
Why don't you just calm down' __eou__ What do you care what he says? __eou__ 
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him. __eou__ Dig. __eou__ 
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty. __eou__ Can we stealth these guys? __eou__ Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing. __eou__ 
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on. __eou__ Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered . __eou__ 
Roger really. People say I talk too much. __eou__ Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up. __eou__ 
What are we gonna do? __eou__ I can run. I got no problem with that. __eou__ 
Me too. __eou__ Did you hear what he just said? __eou__ If I'm going in, I want a stake. __eou__ 
We've met once or twice. Last time was in... __eou__ County. I was in for fraud. __eou__ You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that? __eou__ I walked. Ninety days, suspended. __eou__ 
How do you do? __eou__ Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at __eou__ 
What the hell do you want? __eou__ I wanted to talk to you. The other guys - __eou__ I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things - __eou__ They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more. __eou__ 
Get out. __eou__ If you'll just let me - __eou__ 
Don't hurt me. __eou__ Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you. __eou__ 
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore. __eou__ McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff. __eou__ 
What fence? Who? __eou__ Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot. __eou__ Never heard of him. __eou__ 
You have to come. __eou__ What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not? __eou__ 
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this. __eou__ Tough break. __eou__ Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place? __eou__ 
You watch your mouth. __eou__ Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool. __eou__ 
I was out of line. __eou__ You okay? __eou__ I'11 be alright. __eou__ Well, I'm sorry. __eou__ Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight. __eou__ 
How are they going to do it? __eou__ McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way. __eou__ Fenster and Hockney? __eou__ They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you. __eou__ Three million? __eou__ Maybe more. __eou__ No killing? __eou__ Not if we do it my way. __eou__ 
We'll make it. __eou__ Don't do this. Send her a card - something. __eou__ We'll make it. __eou__ 
What is it Keaton? __eou__ Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open? __eou__ 
What is this? __eou__ Who's Keyser Soze? __eou__ 
What-are they speaking? __eou__ Russian, I think. I don't know. __eou__ Hungarian? __eou__ 
Keaton, I can't just - __eou__ I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way. __eou__ What if I __eou__ Just do what I tell you. __eou__ 
How are you, Keaton? __eou__ I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser. __eou__ 
Ready? __eou__ What time is it? __eou__ 
Let's say for example - __eou__ This I had to see myself. __eou__ 
with what? __eou__ You know damn well, dead-man. __eou__ Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been __eou__ 
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit. __eou__ Who's your boss? __eou__ My employer wishes to remain anonymous. __eou__ Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man? __eou__ I work for Keyser Sate. __eou__ 
You set up the line-up. __eou__ Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point. __eou__ What about Redfoot? __eou__ Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people. __eou__ 
The answer is no. __eou__ Mr. Soze will be most - __eou__ Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here. __eou__ A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot. __eou__ 
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us. __eou__ We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off. __eou__ Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it. __eou__ Neither do we. __eou__ 
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined. __eou__ We'll see. __eou__ 
What did you say? __eou__ Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday. __eou__ 
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus. __eou__ You're lying. __eou__ Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR __eou__ 
We're on vacation. __eou__ I've got a ton of work and no good people. __eou__ 
Take your time. Enjoy L.A. __eou__ A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis. __eou__ I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved. __eou__ I shivved him. __eou__ 
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later. __eou__ Business or personal? __eou__ 
A little of both. __eou__ Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested. __eou__ 
Get a grip. I didn't know. __eou__ You didn't know. __eou__ 
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer. __eou__ Who is he? __eou__ Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask. __eou__ We want to meet him. __eou__ He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him' __eou__ Tell him we'll meet. __eou__ 
What do you mean I can't see him? __eou__ The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal. __eou__ Did they charge him with anything? __eou__ 
Weapons. Misdemeanor two. __eou__ What'the fuck is that? __eou__ 
When does he post bail? __eou__ Two hours, tops. __eou__ I want to see him. __eou__ 
He won't go into the interrogation room. __eou__ Someplace else, then. __eou__ Where? __eou__ 
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton. __eou__ Which is shit. __eou__ No matter. He'll have to know how close we came. __eou__ Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again. __eou__ I'11 find him. __eou__ Waste of time. __eou__ A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die. __eou__ What? __eou__ Nothing. Something I - forget it. __eou__ 
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired __eou__ This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time. __eou__ 
No, no, no, no, no. __eou__ If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in? __eou__ And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions. __eou__ You know damn well what I think. __eou__ 
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know. __eou__ I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead. __eou__ 
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings. __eou__ Kobayashi. __eou__ 
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you. __eou__ Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was - __eou__ Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything. __eou__ I told the D.A. everything I know. __eou__ 
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man. __eou__ I know he was good. __eou__ He was a corrupt cop, Verbal. __eou__ 
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit. __eou__ Keaton was a piece of shit. __eou__ 
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan? __eou__ I just want to hear your story. __eou__ 
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else. __eou__ That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible. __eou__ Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity . __eou__ Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time. __eou__ You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal? __eou__ You know a religious guy named John Paul? __eou__ You know Ruby is in Attica? __eou__ He didn't have my lawyer. __eou__ I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much. __eou__ 
There's nothing in there about Ruby. __eou__ I'11 be sure to mention that to him. __eou__ 
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow? __eou__ No. __eou__ I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not. __eou__ I'm not a rat. __eou__ 
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy. __eou__ You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you. __eou__ Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her. __eou__ He loved her. __eou__ Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea __eou__ 
That was all Fenster and McManus. __eou__ Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service __eou__ 
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        + __eou__ Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        + __eou__ You got him wrong. __eou__ Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either. __eou__ 
I don't know about that. __eou__ I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York. __eou__ He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer. __eou__ What lawyer? __eou__ 
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes. __eou__ The D.A. gave me immunity. __eou__ NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison, __eou__ 
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi. __eou__ Is he the one that killed Keaton? __eou__ No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead. __eou__ Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters. __eou__ 
So this lawyer... __eou__ Kobayashi. __eou__ Came from Redfoot. __eou__ Right. __eou__ And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.? __eou__ 
Do you believe in him, Verbal? __eou__ Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE. __eou__ 
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal. __eou__ And this is why you never told the D.A. __eou__ You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say? __eou__ Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out. __eou__ 
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me? __eou__ If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you. __eou__ Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail. __eou__ So why play into his hands? We can protect you. __eou__ Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again. __eou__ 
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois. __eou__ This is totally irrelevant. __eou__ Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything. __eou__ Can we just get back to Kobayashi? __eou__ The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us. __eou__ 
You're stalling, Verbal. __eou__ Give a guy a break, huh? __eou__ What happened? __eou__ 
Then what? __eou__ McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call. __eou__ What call? __eou__ Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster. __eou__ 
I wanted to. I thought we could make it. __eou__ Why didn't you say anything? __eou__ I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's __eou__ 
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall. __eou__ Wait a minute. __eou__ I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was. __eou__ 
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at. __eou__ I don't. __eou__ YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON . __eou__ 
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING . __eou__ I don't know what you're talking about. __eou__ YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME. __eou__ 
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you. __eou__ Then why didn't you help him? __eou__ I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him. __eou__ But Keaton... __eou__ It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back? __eou__ 
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder. __eou__ I never heard of him. __eou__ His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them. __eou__ I said I never heard of him. __eou__ 
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew. __eou__ I don't __eou__ There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death. __eou__ But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone? __eou__ 
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat? __eou__ He wanted me to live. __eou__ Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why' __eou__ Edie. __eou__ I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why? __eou__ Because he was my friend. __eou__ No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will. __eou__ 
No... __eou__ Keaton was Keyser Soze __eou__ NO. __eou__ 
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. __eou__ THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN. __eou__ 
Edie... __eou__ He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him. __eou__ This is all bullshit. __eou__ He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die. __eou__ I knew him. He would never - __eou__ He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been __eou__ 
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth. __eou__ It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning. __eou__ 
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ __eou__ Why lie about everything else, then? __eou__ You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't __eou__ 
You're not safe on your own. __eou__ You think he's..? __eou__ Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you. __eou__ I'm not bait. No way. I post today. __eou__ You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's. __eou__ I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop. __eou__ Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there. __eou__ Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's __eou__ 
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible. __eou__ The district attorney's office will comply provided - __eou__ No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity. __eou__ May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here. __eou__ Immunity. __eou__ 
Counselor, I will prosecute your client. __eou__ Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention. __eou__ 
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars. __eou__ Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession. __eou__ You're joking. __eou__ Weapons. Misdemeanor one. __eou__ Counselor, you're insulting me. __eou__ Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two? __eou__ 
Mr. Abraham... __eou__ Abrams... __eou__ Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today? __eou__ I'm fine. __eou__ Good.    You ever been inside a hospital? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Ah.  How did they treat you? __eou__ 
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney? __eou__ She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors. __eou__ What did he find? __eou__ Nothing. __eou__ How good's your intelligence? __eou__ Very good. __eou__ And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson? __eou__ As far as we know, nothing. __eou__ 
He was accused of jury tampering. __eou__ Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks. __eou__ Four cases in three years ... __eou__ The man's an ambulance chaser ... __eou__ ... tell me about this case. __eou__ This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court. __eou__ No -- we don't want this case in court. __eou__ Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff. __eou__ I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed. __eou__ No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not. __eou__ So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me. __eou__ All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial. __eou__ 
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case? __eou__ Well, of course, it's always dangerous ... __eou__ I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ 
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture... __eou__ How did you settle on the amount? __eou__ We thought it was just. __eou__ You thought it was just. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy. __eou__ That was our insurance company's recommendation. __eou__ Yes.  It would be. __eou__ 
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well. __eou__ And no one will know the truth. __eou__ What is the truth? __eou__ That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it. __eou__ 
What are you doing here? __eou__ Mickey told me to come back to work. __eou__ 
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ... __eou__ ... yes.  Get her on the phone ... __eou__ ... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ... __eou__ Gruber... __eou__ Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.' __eou__ 
... he wants to testify ...? __eou__ It looks that way. __eou__ You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify? __eou__ ... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that. __eou__ 
This is going to drive the ante up. __eou__ Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ... __eou__ 
That's the call that I'm waiting for. __eou__ What does it mean? __eou__ They want to settle.    It means a lot of money. __eou__ Does that mean I'm back for awhile? __eou__ 
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient... __eou__ Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth. __eou__ 
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Say it. __eou__ I was her doctor. __eou__ You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy... __eou__ ...I was one of a group of... __eou__ Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ 
Anything special about the case? __eou__ When she... __eou__ 
Thank you.  When Debby... __eou__ Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you? __eou__ Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course... __eou__ 
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse... __eou__ What did these people do when her heart stopped? __eou__ We went to Code Blue... __eou__ `Code Blue,' what does that mean...? __eou__ It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins... __eou__ Why wasn't she getting oxygen...? __eou__ Well, many reasons, actually... __eou__ Tell me one? __eou__ She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask... __eou__ She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK. __eou__ 
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen. __eou__ That's right. __eou__ And what did your team do... __eou__ Well, we... __eou__ ...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ ...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form... __eou__ ...We did everything we could... __eou__ ...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that... __eou__ Yes! __eou__ You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right? __eou__ My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know... __eou__ Tell us. __eou__ 
Ed Concannon. __eou__ Frank Galvin.  We've met before. __eou__ 
Objection, we've... __eou__ ...to get her heartbeat back...? __eou__ We've touched on this, his own witness has said... __eou__ ...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage. __eou__ Your Honor...!  Your Honor... __eou__ 
Objection! __eou__ And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives. __eou__ 
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct? __eou__ That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion. __eou__ Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today? __eou__ Just as you are, Sir... __eou__ Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor? __eou__ No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State... __eou__ ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine? __eou__ No. __eou__ Neurology? __eou__ No. __eou__ Orthopedics? __eou__ I'm just an M.D. __eou__ Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...? __eou__ I know of him. __eou__ How is that? __eou__ Through, through his book. __eou__ What book is that? __eou__ Meth...Methodology and Technique... __eou__ ...of Anesthesiology? __eou__ `Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes. __eou__ How old are you? __eou__ I am seventy-four years old. __eou__ Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine? __eou__ I'm on the staff of... __eou__ Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there? __eou__ Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done. __eou__ Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine. __eou__ 
I did. __eou__ Objection. __eou__ 
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars. __eou__ Huh! __eou__ My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way. __eou__ 
Mr. Concannon...? __eou__ Nothing further, your Honor. __eou__ Mr. Galvin, rebuttal? __eou__ 
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right... __eou__ I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed. __eou__ 
No further questions. __eou__ You may step down. __eou__ 
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form. __eou__ ...one moment, Mr. Concannon... __eou__ 
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original... __eou__ Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here. __eou__ I'm going to uphold that. __eou__ 
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...? __eou__ It's a crime. __eou__ Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime. __eou__ I wouldn't do it. __eou__ You would not...? __eou__ No. __eou__ In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Just now... __eou__ Yes. __eou__ ...sworn before God you would tell the truth? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ? __eou__ I . . .. __eou__ And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...? __eou__ I...yes. __eou__ Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying? __eou__ I... __eou__ You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names. __eou__ 
They lied. __eou__ `They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is? __eou__ I do.  Yes. __eou__ You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago. __eou__ That's not my handwriting. __eou__ You've just said you signed it. __eou__ Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure. __eou__ You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years? __eou__ Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here. __eou__ 
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that? __eou__ I thought I would need it. __eou__ And why, please tell us, would you think that? __eou__ After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse... __eou__ 
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers. __eou__ ... that's all right. __eou__ I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here. __eou__ 
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial... __eou__ I doubt we'll have to go to trial ... __eou__ ... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way. __eou__ I completely understand ... __eou__ We just ... __eou__ 
What is this going to cost? __eou__ It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ... __eou__ 
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...? __eou__ Hold on a second. __eou__ I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did? __eou__ 
It's all right, Mickey. __eou__ You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister. __eou__ I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case... __eou__ What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred... __eou__ I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars. __eou__ You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives. __eou__ 
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back. __eou__ I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred. __eou__ 
They gave her the wrong anesthetic. __eou__ Why is that? __eou__ Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she... __eou__ ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to... __eou__ ...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart. __eou__ Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please? __eou__ I am seventy-four years old. __eou__ What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics? __eou__ I am on the staff of... __eou__ Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say... __eou__ ...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I... __eou__ 
She getting good care over there? __eou__ Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I... __eou__ Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means? __eou__ 'Code Blue'... __eou__ It's a common medical term. __eou__ 
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice? __eou__ Well... __eou__ 
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.' __eou__ Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question? __eou__ I...given the limits of your question, that's correct. __eou__ The Doctors were not negligent. __eou__ I...um... __eou__ 
Dr. Thompson...? __eou__ It was good of you to meet... __eou__ 
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening... __eou__ That's what I'd planned to... __eou__ I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl... __eou__ From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case... __eou__ Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my... __eou__ ...I made a reservation at... __eou__ ...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they... __eou__ ...What difference would... __eou__ These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I... __eou__ There's nothing they can do to me. __eou__ 
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? __eou__ Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today. __eou__ Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct? __eou__ It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage. __eou__ 
I didn't do too well for you. __eou__ No, you did fine. __eou__ I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday? __eou__ No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home. __eou__ You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth. __eou__ Yes...I...yes. __eou__ 
You sure you don't want me to stay on. __eou__ No.  No.  Thank you. You go home. __eou__ 
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar? __eou__ Yes.  I wrote it. __eou__ 
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct? __eou__ I.  Yes.  It is. __eou__ And you wrote that... __eou__ Yes. __eou__ ...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask? __eou__ She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission. __eou__ If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...? __eou__ Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case. __eou__ Thank you. __eou__ 
Dr. Gruber ... __eou__ Yes?  Galvin, right? __eou__ 
I appreciate--a man as busy as-- __eou__ That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk? __eou__ 
I read the hospital report on your client. __eou__ ... Deborah Ann Kaye ... __eou__ ... Deborah Ann Kaye ... __eou__ 
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ... __eou__ Right.  Who called? __eou__ The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ... __eou__ ... and you're going to do that? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ You're going to settle out of court? __eou__ 
Yes. __eou__ Why? __eou__ 
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ... __eou__ Her doctors killed her. __eou__ ) I'm sorry ...? __eou__ Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her. __eou__ Do you know who her doctors were? __eou__ I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were. __eou__ The most respected ... __eou__ Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill? __eou__ 
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ... __eou__ What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ... __eou__ 
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition.. __eou__ Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way? __eou__ 
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ... __eou__ I understand. __eou__ ... the case with anyone.  And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony ... __eou__ 
Thank you ... __eou__ ... that's perfectly all right. __eou__ Uh, why, why are you doing this? __eou__ To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it? __eou__ 
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure. __eou__ I told the guy I didn't want to talk to... __eou__ I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is? __eou__ No. __eou__ He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what? __eou__ ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me? __eou__ I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big... __eou__ I've got nothing to say to you. __eou__ You know what happened. __eou__ Nothing happened. __eou__ Then why aren't you testifying for their side? __eou__ 
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand. __eou__ And ask me what? __eou__ Who put my client in the hospital for life. __eou__ I didn't do it, Mister. __eou__ Who are you protecting, then? __eou__ Who says that I'm protecting anyone? __eou__ I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them? __eou__ I don't owe them a goddamn thing. __eou__ Then why don't you testify? __eou__ You know, you're pushy, fella... __eou__ You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand... __eou__ Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores. __eou__ 
Yessir.  I'm sorry. __eou__ Why is that? __eou__ I was held up. __eou__ 
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother. __eou__ This is a complicated case, your Honor... __eou__ I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop? __eou__ My client can't walk, your Honor. __eou__ I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you. __eou__ 
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records. __eou__ ...things change. __eou__ ...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred... __eou__ I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro... __eou__ And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief. __eou__ I'm sure you would. __eou__ 
What is it? __eou__ Thank you for seeing me. __eou__ That's perfectly all right. __eou__ 
I need an extension for my case. __eou__ You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared. __eou__ I had a witness disappear on me. __eou__ That happens. __eou__ I could subpoena him if I had a week. __eou__ I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you. __eou__ 
Is the Plaintiff ready? __eou__ Ready, your Honor. __eou__ Defense...? __eou__ 
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon. __eou__ Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility? __eou__ 
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records. __eou__ What? __eou__ I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...? __eou__ 
Yes, Mr. Galvin? __eou__ If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way... __eou__ I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence? __eou__ 
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today. __eou__ I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me. __eou__ Listen to me, fella... __eou__ No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair. __eou__ 
Galvin, look, many years ago... __eou__ And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are. __eou__ Are you done? __eou__ Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass. __eou__ You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail. __eou__ 
Nothing further, your Honor... __eou__ Mr. Concannon...? __eou__ 
I object, your Honor... __eou__ Overruled... __eou__ Exception! __eou__ Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed... __eou__ 
Continental Casualty... __eou__ Mr. Alito, please. __eou__ Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch... __eou__ I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number? __eou__ I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed... __eou__ ...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him... __eou__ I can't guarantee that... __eou__ I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent. __eou__ 
Mr. Galvin's... __eou__ Let me talk to Mickey. __eou__ 
Hello, I'm calling from... __eou__ If you're selling something, I'm late for work... __eou__ I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly... __eou__ From the magazine? __eou__ This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions? __eou__ How come you're calling me from...? __eou__ This is Miss Costello...? __eou__ Yes.  Price... __eou__ Pardon? __eou__ Kathy Price. __eou__ We find that your subscription lapsed... __eou__ My subscription lapsed three years ago... __eou__ That's why I'm calling, Miss Price... __eou__ Missus... __eou__ We have a renew-your-subscription offer... __eou__ We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work. __eou__ Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center... __eou__ No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work. __eou__ 
D'you find an apartment? __eou__ Still looking. __eou__ I changed my life today.  What did you do? __eou__ I changed my room at the Hotel. __eou__ Why? __eou__ The TV didn't work. __eou__ What Hotel are you staying at? __eou__ And what are you?  A cop? __eou__ I'm a lawyer. __eou__ My ex-husband was a lawyer. __eou__ Really.  How wonderful for you. __eou__ Yes.  It was, actually. __eou__ Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off? __eou__ Who says I'm the one that called it off? __eou__ A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name? __eou__ Laura. __eou__ My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight. __eou__ What if it wasn't you that I came back to see? __eou__ You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on. __eou__ 
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink? __eou__ I think I will. __eou__ 
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice. __eou__ And are they going to get it? __eou__ They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...' __eou__ Maybe what? __eou__ Maybe I can do something right. __eou__ And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...? __eou__ That's what I'm going to try to do. __eou__ 
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --? __eou__ What...? __eou__ Is this a bad time. __eou__ We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do... __eou__ What happened...? __eou__ They, uh, they got to my witness. __eou__ ...and is that serious? __eou__ 
I've got to work... __eou__ Do you want me to go...? __eou__ No, no, I'm just... __eou__ 
Why don't you get some rest? __eou__ I've got to work. __eou__ You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on... __eou__ You're going to stay here...? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ 
Do you think it's my fault? __eou__ Isn't there something you... __eou__ That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win. __eou__ You're talking like a drunk. __eou__ That's what I am. __eou__ 
And it's over...? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Well, then what are you doing here? __eou__ I...do you want me to leave? __eou__ You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself? __eou__ I... __eou__ You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in. __eou__ Who told you that? __eou__ You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place. __eou__ And what makes you so tough? __eou__ Maybe I'll tell you later. __eou__ Is there going to be a later...? __eou__ Not if you don't grow up... __eou__ If I don't 'grow up...' __eou__ You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school... __eou__ You, you don't under... __eou__ Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you! __eou__ It's over! __eou__ What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your... __eou__ What is that to you...? __eou__ What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure. __eou__ 
Joe...  Joe... __eou__ Stop pressuring me... __eou__ 
You're pressuring yourself... __eou__ No...no... __eou__ Yes.   We've all got to let go. __eou__ 
Is it over? __eou__ No. __eou__ What are you going to do? __eou__ I don't have a goddamned idea. __eou__ 
Thank you. __eou__ I have to talk to you. __eou__ Call the A.M.A.  to Laura) ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse... __eou__ 
Dr. Gruber. __eou__ Dr. Gruber's not in. __eou__ I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting... __eou__ He's not in, Sir. __eou__ Where is he? __eou__ 
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him... __eou__ Dr. Halpern's taking all his... __eou__ No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.

If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number... __eou__ 
Hi, Mickey ... __eou__ What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...? __eou__ Uh ... __eou__ Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ... __eou__ ... now who is that ...? __eou__ ... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ... __eou__ Sally Doneghy, now who is that? __eou__ One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ... __eou__ ... hey, I don't need your charity ... __eou__ ... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file. __eou__ 
I have to talk to you. __eou__ What do you want? __eou__ Come on.  Let's get a drink. __eou__ Don't touch anything. __eou__ 
Are you out of your mind...? __eou__ ...I'm going to need your help... __eou__ You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life? __eou__ I'm going to help her. __eou__ To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead... __eou__ They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it... __eou__ That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer... __eou__ 
Mick.  Mick.  Mick... __eou__ What? __eou__ You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...' __eou__ I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon. __eou__ ...he's a good man... __eou__ ...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case. __eou__ ...I have to stand up for her... __eou__ Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back. __eou__ I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...? __eou__ 
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point. __eou__ You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance. __eou__ Admittance form is wrong. __eou__ Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash. __eou__ I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains... __eou__ ...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...' __eou__ They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse? __eou__ No. __eou__ 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up. __eou__ Right. __eou__ Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan. __eou__ Right. __eou__ Brindisi versus Electric Boat. __eou__ You got a good memory, Franky. __eou__ I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport... __eou__ 
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow. __eou__ Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight? __eou__ I'm going to get laid. __eou__ 
Been a long time, huh...? __eou__ I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse? __eou__ Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this. __eou__ 
So what? __eou__ So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.' __eou__ They still have to take it to a jury. __eou__ 
What I'm saying, they're getting some help. __eou__ So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case. __eou__ 
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray. __eou__ Oh shit, what's today? __eou__ Today is Tuesday.  What? __eou__ I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have? __eou__ Give 'em a box of Macanudos. __eou__ Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it. __eou__ 
What happened, Joey...? __eou__ I can't talk now. __eou__ D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...? __eou__ 
Yeah?  How's our new witness? __eou__ D'you find the obstetric nurse? __eou__ She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to... __eou__ Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her. __eou__ 
How are you holding up? __eou__ I'm swell. __eou__ And all we've got is a witch doctor! __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ 
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness? __eou__ You use their witness. __eou__ That's right. __eou__ I think we tried that.  The case is over. __eou__ 
Are you with me...are you awake...? __eou__ Yeah.  I'm awake. __eou__ Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting? __eou__ The Doctors. __eou__ She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand... __eou__ Read me what she said. __eou__ 
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...' __eou__ ...one of the other nurses? __eou__ Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand. __eou__ All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.? __eou__ What difference can that make...? All right... __eou__ 
Uh...the admitting nurse... __eou__ What did she do? __eou__ She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...' __eou__ The 'History'...? __eou__ How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ... __eou__ 
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association? __eou__ The broad has disappeared... __eou__ The Hospital...? __eou__ 
...yeah...good... __eou__ ...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying... __eou__ 
...four years ago... __eou__ Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello... __eou__ I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette... __eou__ 
What the hell are you doing here? __eou__ We got to talk. __eou__ 
What are you doing in New York...? __eou__ Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee... __eou__ 
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe? __eou__ I don't know. __eou__ 
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...? __eou__ I don't want a mistrial. __eou__ 
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in? __eou__ It's locked. __eou__ It's locked? __eou__ 
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ... __eou__ ... we, we love her, Dick and me ... __eou__ ... I'm sure you do ... __eou__ But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ... __eou__ ... I know.  I went ... __eou__ ... You saw her? __eou__ Yes.  Yes, I have. __eou__ You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment. __eou__ ... fifty thousand dollars? __eou__ I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ... __eou__ ... I understand ... __eou__ My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ... __eou__ ... I understand ... __eou__ ... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right. __eou__ 
He saw her at the Northern Care... __eou__ ... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ... __eou__ 
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away. __eou__ I'm going to see you get that chance. __eou__ 
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics... __eou__ We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to... __eou__ Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though... __eou__ Yes. __eou__ 
I spoke to her, and everything is all right. __eou__ I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said... __eou__ She told me. __eou__ She did? __eou__ I just saw her. __eou__ In New York? __eou__ What? __eou__ You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...? __eou__ 
Hi. __eou__ Hi.  How are you doing? __eou__ 
I've been meaning to come in a long time. __eou__ You live in the neighborhood? __eou__ Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by. __eou__ How old is he? __eou__ Four.  You're great with these kids. __eou__ 
Thank you. __eou__ You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse? __eou__ Who told you that? __eou__ Mrs... __eou__ Mrs. Simmonds. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ I used to be a nurse. __eou__ That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop? __eou__ 
Kathy Price... __eou__ Yes... __eou__ You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted... __eou__ Yes. __eou__ 
Yes. __eou__ These are your initials, 'K.C.'? __eou__ Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name. __eou__ 
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ What did she say? __eou__ She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital. __eou__ One hour. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour? __eou__ I did. __eou__ A single hour. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ 
Another, Frank . . . ? __eou__ ...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too. __eou__ 
I want to buy you a drink. __eou__ Thanks, Franky. __eou__ 
Well, well, well.  Huh? __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ It's a long road that has no turning. __eou__ That's for sure, Frank. __eou__ 
Dr. Towler... __eou__ Yes. __eou__ You have a record of what happened in the operating room... __eou__ Yes, that's correct. __eou__ ...there are notations every thirty seconds... __eou__ Yes. __eou__ ...of the procedures... __eou__ Yes, the roving nurse... __eou__ But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's... __eou__ We, we were rather busy... __eou__ Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes... __eou__ As I've said we had some more... __eou__ ...they start again three minutes earlier... __eou__ We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her... __eou__ What happened in those three... __eou__ ...we were trying to restore her heartbeat. __eou__ What happened in those three minutes...? __eou__ We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro... __eou__ Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat... __eou__ 
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two... __eou__ Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Huh.  And why is that? __eou__ Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway... __eou__ 
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other. __eou__ How'm I doing so far? __eou__ So far you're great.  You got a cigarette? __eou__ 
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is? __eou__ Should I? __eou__ A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ ...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case. __eou__ The Big Boy did...? __eou__ That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out. __eou__ Huh. __eou__ Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you? __eou__ Me, too. __eou__ Okay.  Now, so he's in jail.  He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake.  As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.   P.S.  He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half years.   You like that story? __eou__ 
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this? __eou__ It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him. __eou__ He won't talk. __eou__ No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background. __eou__ I can give you one thing: he was in love with her. __eou__ Ah? That complicates the problem. __eou__ I'll give you another complication: he still is. __eou__ 
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin? __eou__ I married into it. __eou__ 
Interesting business. __eou__ No, to be honest, I find it dull. __eou__ You don't have to do it for a living. __eou__ No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here. __eou__ How long have you been back? __eou__ Almost a year. __eou__ And you like it. __eou__ San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast. __eou__ 
Like all this. __eou__ I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom. __eou__ 
Shouldn't you be sitting down? __eou__ No, I'm all right. __eou__ I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability? __eou__ No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town. __eou__ 
Would you like a drink now? __eou__ No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin? __eou__ 
Not what you think. We're very happily married. __eou__ Then? __eou__ I'm afraid some harm may come to her. __eou__ From whom? __eou__ Someone dead. __eou__ 
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being? __eou__ No. __eou__ If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say? __eou__ I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both. __eou__ Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie. __eou__ 
I didn't mean to be that rough. __eou__ No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up? __eou__ No. __eou__ I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why... __eou__ How often does this happen? __eou__ More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day. __eou__ Where'd she go? __eou__ 
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all. __eou__ Well? __eou__ The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors. __eou__ Have you talked to the doctors at all? __eou__ Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie -- __eou__ I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys -- __eou__ I want you. __eou__ It's not my line. __eou__ Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this! __eou__ 
How can I see her, to know her? __eou__ We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier? __eou__ Ernie's. __eou__ All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal... __eou__ 
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job. __eou__ That's Carlotta Valdes. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ There are things you didn't tell me. __eou__ I didn't know where she was going to lead you. __eou__ But you knew about this. __eou__ Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair. __eou__ 
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again. __eou__ Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother? __eou__ Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother. __eou__ Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that. __eou__ But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes. __eou__ Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor? __eou__ Nothing. __eou__ And when she goes to those places... __eou__ She is not my wife. __eou__ 
How do you know all these things she doesn't know? __eou__ Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here. __eou__ Why did she never tell her daughter? __eou__ Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely. __eou__ 
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved. __eou__ I -- I -- __eou__ No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go... __eou__ 
Hello. __eou__ Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet. __eou__ No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon. __eou__ What happened? __eou__ She... went into the Bay. __eou__ 
Hello? __eou__ Did she hurt herself? __eou__ No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did. __eou__ 
Could I ask you a couple of questions? __eou__ What for? Who are you? __eou__ My name is John Ferguson, and -- __eou__ Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something? __eou__ No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and -- __eou__ Do you live here in the hotel? __eou__ No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought -- __eou__ 0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it! __eou__ 
No, please! I Just want to talk to you! __eou__ Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute! __eou__ I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please! __eou__ 
Just let me talk to you. __eou__ What about? __eou__ You. __eou__ Why? __eou__ 
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh! __eou__ You're not far wrong. __eou__ Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go. __eou__ Let me come in. __eou__ 
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud. __eou__ You won't have to. __eou__ Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper... __eou__ 
What do you want to know? __eou__ Your name. And -- __eou__ Judy Barton. __eou__ Who you are -- __eou__ Just a girl, I work at Magnin's -- __eou__ -- and how you happen to be living here. __eou__ It's a place to live, that's all. __eou__ But you haven't lived here long. __eou__ About three years. __eou__ No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!? __eou__ I told you! Right here! __eou__ But before! Where did you live before!?! __eou__ Salina, Kansas! __eou__ 
Listen, what is this? What do you want? __eou__ I want to know who you are. __eou__ I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it? __eou__ 
Will you have dinner with me? __eou__ Why? __eou__ Well, I feel I owe you something for all this... __eou__ No, you don't owe me anything. __eou__ Then will you for me? __eou__ Dinner... and what else? __eou__ Just dinner. __eou__ Because I remind you of her? __eou__ Because I'd like to have dinner with you. __eou__ 
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay. __eou__ I'll get my car and be back in half an hour. __eou__ Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up! __eou__ An hour? __eou__ Mmm. __eou__ Okay. __eou__ 
Thank you again. Good-night. __eou__ Can I see you tomorrow? __eou__ Tomorrow night? Well -- __eou__ Tomorrow morning. __eou__ Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job. __eou__ Don't go. __eou__ And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas? __eou__ I'll take care of you. __eou__ Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks. __eou__ No, Judy, you don't understand. __eou__ Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night. __eou__ No. __eou__ No? Then what? __eou__ I just want to see you as much as I can! __eou__ As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen... __eou__ No. __eou__ That's not very complimentary, either. __eou__ 
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair! __eou__ Why?! __eou__ Please! And don't look at me. __eou__ 
Will you, Judy? __eou__ I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick. __eou__ 
I like that one. __eou__ No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that? __eou__ Yes -- __eou__ 
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes. __eou__ Honest? __eou__ 
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on. __eou__ But Scottie, you don't have to! __eou__ I want to! Come on! __eou__ 
But I like that one, Scottie. __eou__ No, it's not right. __eou__ 
Scottie, what are you doing? __eou__ I'm trying to buy you a suit. __eou__ But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful. __eou__ They're none of them right. __eou__ But why? __eou__ 
You want me to dress like her? __eou__ Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you. __eou__ Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead! __eou__ Judy -- __eou__ It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead? __eou__ 
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but -- __eou__ No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here! __eou__ Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please! __eou__ 
I don't like it! __eou__ We'll take it! Will it fit? __eou__ 
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away. __eou__ You can. __eou__ No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go... __eou__ 
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year. __eou__ I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much. __eou__ No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you. __eou__ 
You don't even want to touch me. __eou__ Yes. Yes, I do. __eou__ 
The color of your hair... __eou__ Ah, no! __eou__ Judy, please it can't matter to you... __eou__ 
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me. __eou__ 
Well? __eou__ It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you. __eou__ We tried it. It didn't suit me. __eou__ 
Where shall we go for dinner? __eou__ Wherever you'd like... __eou__ Ernie's? __eou__ You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you? __eou__ Well, after all, it's "our place." __eou__ 
Mmmm. __eou__ Is that the best you can do? __eou__ 
Come here. __eou__ Oh, no. You'll muss me. __eou__ That's what I had in mind. __eou__ Too late. I've got my face on. __eou__ 
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else? __eou__ No, Ernie's is fine. __eou__ I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start... __eou__ 
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck. __eou__ Oh! You're supposed to fasten it! __eou__ All in good time. __eou__ 
Scottie! __eou__ How does it work? __eou__ Can't you see? __eou__ Oh, yeah. There. __eou__ 
We're going awfully far. __eou__ I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry? __eou__ No, it's all right. __eou__ 
Where are you going? __eou__ To complete my cure. __eou__ 
Scottie, why are we here? __eou__ I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time. __eou__ But why? Why here? __eou__ Madeleine died here. __eou__ 
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here. __eou__ I need you. __eou__ Why? __eou__ I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free. __eou__ 
I'm scared. __eou__ So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now. __eou__ 
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you -- __eou__ Scottie -- __eou__ -- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did. __eou__ 
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy. __eou__ Take me away... __eou__ You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs. __eou__ No! __eou__ Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow. __eou__ 
We're going up the tower, Madeleine. __eou__ No! Let me go! __eou__ We're going up the tower. __eou__ You can't. You're afraid! __eou__ I'm going to. It's my second chance. __eou__ 
Scottie, please...! __eou__ But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife? __eou__ Yes! __eou__ And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there? __eou__ Dead. He'd broken her neck. __eou__ Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream? __eou__ I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it -- __eou__ Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!! __eou__ 
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do? __eou__ Yes! __eou__ And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!! __eou__ Your accident... __eou__ Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now? __eou__ I don't know... Switzerland? __eou__ We'll find him. __eou__ 
I made it. __eou__ What are you going to do? __eou__ Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in. __eou__ 
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything? __eou__ Some money. __eou__ And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental. __eou__ 
What are you going to do? __eou__ I loved you, Madeleine. __eou__ I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe! __eou__ 
Love me... keep me safe... __eou__ Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back. __eou__ 
Why am I here? What happened? __eou__ You...  ...fell into the Bay. __eou__ 
You don't remember. __eou__ No... __eou__ Do you remember where you were? __eou__ Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted! __eou__ Where were you? __eou__ At... __eou__ 
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there! __eou__ Why? __eou__ Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire. __eou__ Where had you been before? __eou__ When? __eou__ This afternoon. __eou__ Oh... wandering about. __eou__ Before?  Where?  Where had you been? __eou__ 
Please drink your coffee. __eou__ I will. You're terribly direct in your questions. __eou__ I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. __eou__ You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point? __eou__ Wandering about. __eou__ You like it, too. __eou__ 
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery. __eou__ Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past. __eou__ 
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you. __eou__ No. __eou__ 
When you...  There were pins in my hair... __eou__ Oh! Yes! Here! __eou__ 
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know. __eou__ I... didn't know where you lived. __eou__ You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you? __eou__ Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way. __eou__ No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster. __eou__ My name is John Ferguson. __eou__ That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack. __eou__ John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie. __eou__ I shall call you Mr. Ferguson. __eou__ No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John. __eou__ I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John? __eou__ Wander about. __eou__ That's a good occupation. And live here... alone? __eou__ 
One shouldn't live alone. __eou__ Some people prefer it. __eou__ No... it's wrong. __eou__ 
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before? __eou__ What? __eou__ ...Falling... into San Francisco Bay? __eou__ 
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before? __eou__ No... this is the first time for me, too. __eou__ 
Oh! Yes. Hello. __eou__ Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that. __eou__ I... suddenly felt such a fool. __eou__ I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right? __eou__ Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology. __eou__ You've nothing to apologize for. __eou__ Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you! __eou__ Not at all, I enjoyed -- __eou__ 
-- talking to you... __eou__ I enjoyed talking to you. __eou__ 
Would you like some coffee? __eou__ No! No, thank you! __eou__ 
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you. __eou__ The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower. __eou__ 
I hope we will, too. __eou__ What? __eou__ Meet again, sometime. __eou__ We have. __eou__ 
Good-bye. __eou__ Good-bye. __eou__ 
I don't know. __eou__ Shopping? __eou__ No. __eou__ Well... anywhere in particular? __eou__ No, I Just thought I'd wander. __eou__ Ah.  That's what I was going to do. __eou__ Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it? __eou__ 
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to... __eou__ Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere. __eou__ No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true. __eou__ 
Do you know where you're going? __eou__ Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been! __eou__ How can you be sure? __eou__ If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't. __eou__ 
How old? __eou__ Oh... some, two thousand years, or more. __eou__ The oldest living things? __eou__ 
What are you thinking? __eou__ Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living. __eou__ Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living. __eou__ I don't like them. __eou__ Why? __eou__ Knowing I have to die... __eou__ 
Do you hear anything? __eou__ Only silence. It's always like this. __eou__ And no birds sing. __eou__ No birds live here. __eou__ No. __eou__ 
Would you like a drink of water? __eou__ No, thank you. __eou__ 
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice... __eou__ Madeleine! __eou__ 
Where are you now? __eou__ Here with you. __eou__ Where? __eou__ The tall trees... __eou__ Have you been here before? __eou__ Yes... __eou__ When? __eou__ 
Where were you born? __eou__ Long ago... __eou__ Where? __eou__ 
No!... No! __eou__ Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away? __eou__ No, don't ask me! __eou__ 
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know. __eou__ I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell! __eou__ Why did you jump? __eou__ No! __eou__ What was it inside that told you to jump? __eou__ 
No, I can't tell you! __eou__ What?! __eou__ No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me! __eou__ 
Take me away from here? __eou__ Home? __eou__ ...somewhere in the light. __eou__ 
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know. __eou__ And you'll go on saving me? Again and again? __eou__ 
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once. __eou__ Yesterday. __eou__ 
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them. __eou__ Vaguely... __eou__ What do you remember? __eou__ A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone... __eou__ Would you know the room? __eou__ No... it's in shadow. __eou__ What else? __eou__ A grave... __eou__ Where? __eou__ I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave. __eou__ How do you know? __eou__ I know. __eou__ There's a name on the gravestone. __eou__ No. It's new and clean, and waiting. __eou__ What else? __eou__ This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone. __eou__ A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait? __eou__ No. __eou__ Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her? __eou__ But I'm the woman in the mirror! __eou__ No! __eou__ 
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together... __eou__ And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it? __eou__ 
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go! __eou__ I'm here, I've got you... __eou__ I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen... __eou__ 
Don't leave me... stay with me... __eou__ All the time. __eou__ 
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you... __eou__ Why? What's happened? __eou__ I had the dream. The dream came back again... __eou__ 
No, don't go away! __eou__ Only this far. __eou__ 
Where's your husband? __eou__ I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know... __eou__ 
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me? __eou__ It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village... __eou__ Yes -- __eou__ But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it... __eou__ Tell me. __eou__ There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside. __eou__ 
Go on. __eou__ At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner -- __eou__ -- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps. __eou__ Yes?! But -- __eou__ It's all there. It's no dream. __eou__ 
You've been there before. You've seen it. __eou__ No, never! __eou__ Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it! __eou__ No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there! __eou__ 
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you? __eou__ I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up... __eou__ 
Here with you. __eou__ And it's a all real. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here! __eou__ 
My love... because I love you. __eou__ I love you too... too late... too late... __eou__ No... we're together... __eou__ Too late... there's something I must do... __eou__ 
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe. __eou__ You can't. __eou__ Why? __eou__ Let me go. __eou__ Where? __eou__ To the church, I must go there. __eou__ Madeleine -- __eou__ Please let me go. __eou__ 
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...! __eou__ It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine -- __eou__ Let me go! Let me go!! __eou__ Madeleine!! __eou__ 
You believe that I love you? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you. __eou__ I won't lose you. __eou__ 
Let me go into the church alone. __eou__ Why? __eou__ Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run. __eou__ 
Is there something I can do for you? __eou__ Yes... you run this hotel. __eou__ Oh, yes! __eou__ Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner? __eou__ Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask -- __eou__ 
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong? __eou__ Please answer my question. __eou__ I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face -- __eou__ What is her name? __eou__ Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know. __eou__ Carlotta Valdes? __eou__ Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet. __eou__ How long has she had the room? __eou__ Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow. __eou__ Does she sleep here? Ever? __eou__ No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered -- __eou__ When she comes down, don't say that I've been here. __eou__ 
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her. __eou__ I saw her come in five minutes. ago. __eou__ Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves! __eou__ 
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack! __eou__ Would you please go and look? __eou__ In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly... __eou__ 
Her car is gone. __eou__ What car? __eou__ 
Ow!! __eou__ I thought you said no more aches and pains? __eou__ It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick. __eou__ No three-way stretch? How very un- chic. __eou__ Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow! __eou__ What's tomorrow? __eou__ Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined. __eou__ 
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets? __eou__ More than you think. __eou__ How do you know? Personal experience? __eou__ Please!  And what happens after tomorrow? __eou__ What do you mean? __eou__ What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force? __eou__ You sound so disapproving, Midge. __eou__ No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day. __eou__ I had to quit, Midge. __eou__ Why? __eou__ I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him. __eou__ It wasn't your fault. __eou__ I know. Everybody tells me. __eou__ Johnny, the doctors explained -- __eou__ I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it. __eou__ Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit? __eou__ And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne? __eou__ It's where you belong. __eou__ Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous! __eou__ Ah, Johnny-O... __eou__ 
Well?... what'll you do? __eou__ Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent. __eou__ Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while? __eou__ To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up. __eou__ Have you had any dizzy spells this week? __eou__ I'm having one now. __eou__ 
From that music. __eou__ Oh! __eou__ 
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now. __eou__ I've never run across one like that. __eou__ It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge. __eou__ Uh-huh! __eou__ An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time. __eou__ What a pleasant hobby. __eou__ 
How's your love life, Midge? __eou__ That's following a train of thought. __eou__ Well? __eou__ Normal. __eou__ Aren't you ever going to get married? __eou__ You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O. __eou__ Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we? __eou__ Three whole weeks. __eou__ Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster? __eou__ Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No. __eou__ I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number. __eou__ That's Skid Row... isn't it? __eou__ Could be. __eou__ He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink. __eou__ Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight.  __eou__ Sorry, old man. Work. __eou__ Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it? __eou__ What. __eou__ My... the acrophobia. __eou__ I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out. __eou__ I think I can lick it. __eou__ How? __eou__ I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see? __eou__ 
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this. __eou__ That!?! __eou__ What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge? __eou__ 
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it. __eou__ Stop kidding. Wait a minute. __eou__ 
Step number two. __eou__ Okay. __eou__ 
Easy, now. __eou__ This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up -- __eou__ 
Johnny! __eou__ Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it -- __eou__ 
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" -- __eou__ Well, who? Come on, you know everybody. __eou__ Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley. __eou__ Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of! __eou__ Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879? __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ Pop Leibel. __eou__ Who? __eou__ Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know? __eou__ Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879. __eou__ 
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on? __eou__ Do you know him well? __eou__ Pop Leibel? Sure. __eou__ All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat? __eou__ 
The poor thing.... __eou__ And she died... __eou__ 
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me. __eou__ For what? __eou__ For bringing you here. Come on, tell! __eou__ Nothing to tell. __eou__ You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on! __eou__ I'll take you home. __eou__ 
Here you are. __eou__ You haven't told me everything. __eou__ I've told you enough. __eou__ Who's the guy, who's the wife? __eou__ Out. I've got things to do. __eou__ I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster. __eou__ Out! __eou__ And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on! __eou__ I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks! __eou__ Think?  Well, what do you think? __eou__ 
Is she pretty? __eou__ Carlotta? __eou__ No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife. __eou__ Mmm, yeah, I guess... __eou__ 
Midge! __eou__ Bye-bye! __eou__ 
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors? __eou__ Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days? __eou__ Just wander. __eou__ Where? __eou__ Around. __eou__ Oh? __eou__ 
Mm. Better. __eou__ Did you need it? __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ Oh? __eou__ 
What was this desperate urge to see me? __eou__ All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me. __eou__ Well, I detected an undercurrent. __eou__ I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie. __eou__ Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner? __eou__ Oh... this and that. __eou__ What I've been doing? __eou__ If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about. __eou__ Naturally. __eou__ 
What have you been doing? __eou__ Wandering. __eou__ 
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting. __eou__ Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department. __eou__ Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this. __eou__ What is it, a still life? __eou__ No, not exactly. Want to see? __eou__ 
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you. __eou__ Oh? __eou__ 
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta... __eou__ What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her? __eou__ It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago. __eou__ By whom? __eou__ By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child. __eou__ 
She died. __eou__ How? __eou__ By her own hand.  There are many such stories. __eou__ Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much. __eou__ 
No, that's not it. Nothing like it. __eou__ But you said grey, sir. __eou__ Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted.  __eou__ 
She'll be out in a moment. __eou__ Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get -- __eou__ 
Yes! That's it! __eou__ I thought so! __eou__ 
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment. __eou__ How soon can it be altered? __eou__ Well... __eou__ Can we have it by tonight? __eou__ Well, if it's absolutely necessary... __eou__ Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out.  __eou__ 
The stripper's here. __eou__ Excellent. __eou__ 
She's fucking hot! __eou__ I need a drink. __eou__ 
Jesus. __eou__ Don't touch her. Call 911. __eou__ 
They'll get us on accesory to murder. __eou__ Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident... __eou__ 
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore. __eou__ That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person! __eou__ 
Can't do what? __eou__ We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car. __eou__ 
How ya doing? __eou__ What? __eou__ What's that? __eou__ What did you say? __eou__ I said how's it going? __eou__ I didn't hear you. __eou__ Well that's what I said. __eou__ 
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then. __eou__ First of all... __eou__ No first of all. I'm not in a game mood. __eou__ You're interrupting a personal conversation. __eou__ Sorry Fish. __eou__ 
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak. __eou__ Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed? __eou__ No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me. __eou__ Boyd brought up divorce statistics. __eou__ 
You're an asshole Adam. __eou__ You're an asshole. __eou__ Oh, and why am I an asshole? __eou__ Multiple reasons. __eou__ Name one. __eou__ I don't have to... __eou__ 
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway... __eou__ Franco mother-fucking Harris! __eou__ 
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around. __eou__ She's dead. __eou__ 
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head. __eou__ Playing? __eou__ 
The floor was wet. She slipped! __eou__ Why was the floor wet? __eou__ I don't know why the floor was wet! __eou__ Why?! __eou__ 
Why? __eou__ It's sacrilegious. __eou__ 
This is pathetic. __eou__ You're pathetic. __eou__ What did you say? __eou__ You're not a team player. __eou__ Don't point at me. __eou__ You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends. __eou__ I have plenty of friends. __eou__ The hell you do. __eou__ The hell I don't. __eou__ You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems. __eou__ What are you fucking talking about? __eou__ 
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us. __eou__ They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd. __eou__ 
About anybody but yourself. You never have. __eou__ And you're a little fucking reject. __eou__ Eat my ass! __eou__ 
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry. __eou__ You're a loser. __eou__ 
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife. __eou__ You fucking bastard! __eou__ 
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck. __eou__ Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you. __eou__ Go home! __eou__ You go home! __eou__ 
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change. __eou__ I'm not getting a ticket. __eou__ 
Don't even start. __eou__ You want to hear me out? __eou__ 
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars. __eou__ You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries. __eou__ I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications. __eou__ 
More. __eou__ Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life. __eou__ 
She's got no fucking pulse. __eou__ You don't know what you're doing. __eou__ 
Wait! __eou__ What? __eou__ What are you doing? __eou__ What are you talking about? __eou__ What do you think you are doing? __eou__ I'm calling the ambulance. __eou__ Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing? __eou__ Calling the ambulance. __eou__ Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance? __eou__ 
We have to call the ambulance. __eou__ Why? __eou__ 
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME! __eou__ Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead? __eou__ Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating. __eou__ 
Are you sure this was an accident? __eou__ You're a lying deviant. What did you do?! __eou__ 
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here. __eou__ We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police. __eou__ Call the police. Okay, that's one option. __eou__ That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here. __eou__ Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options. __eou__ 
Stop it! __eou__ There's more. __eou__ Just stop. __eou__ Just giving the facts. __eou__ I'm calling the police. __eou__ What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal... __eou__ 
Bury her out in the desert. __eou__ Sure, why not. __eou__ 
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman. __eou__ We can do this. We can get her out of here. __eou__ Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone? __eou__ Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows. __eou__ 
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem. __eou__ It's a marble floor, we can clean it up. __eou__ 
Her fucking head was caved in. __eou__ So I didn't fucking do it! __eou__ She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down. __eou__ 
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done. __eou__ You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony? __eou__ We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear. __eou__ What about the blood? __eou__ Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works. __eou__ Have you ever done this before? __eou__ The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this. __eou__ 
Sun rises at 5:52. __eou__ I'm not wrecking the transmission! __eou__ 
Wait. Wait a minute. __eou__ What? __eou__ We can't do this. __eou__ We've already done this. __eou__ No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases. __eou__ 
How do you figure? __eou__ According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace. __eou__ So that's what we're doing. __eou__ No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them. __eou__ She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia. __eou__ That is absolutely not true. __eou__ Well what the fuck are we supposed to do? __eou__ Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs. __eou__ 
We have to get going. __eou__ I am not flexible on this. __eou__ Alright. Let's do it. __eou__ 
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud. __eou__ We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first. __eou__ Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less. __eou__ 
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down! __eou__ What does that mean? __eou__ You got us into this mess. __eou__ Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head. __eou__ Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure! __eou__ Lighten up Adam. Show some character. __eou__ Don't talk to me about character. __eou__ Watch the tone fella. __eou__ 
Fuck you Boyd! __eou__ Any time fat boy! __eou__ 
What is your problem? __eou__ I can't do this. __eou__ 
What? __eou__ At the seven-eleven. __eou__ Who? What are you talking about? __eou__ They're on me. They're smoking me out! __eou__ Nobody's smoking anybody out. __eou__ 
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here. __eou__ I don't give a damn. __eou__ 
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in! __eou__ Adam! Calm down. __eou__ I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work. __eou__ It has worked. __eou__ I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out. __eou__ They won't figure it out. __eou__ I got children. I've got a life. __eou__ 
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right? __eou__ No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all. __eou__ 
Don't snap at them! __eou__ They're driving me nuts! __eou__ They're singing. __eou__ 
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts. __eou__ What? __eou__ They're screaming for Starbursts. __eou__ Later. __eou__ They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts. __eou__ 
Where's the candy? __eou__ There is no candy! __eou__ What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?! __eou__ 
We'll be ready Adam. __eou__ I know you'll be.  Three hours. __eou__ 
That's one idea. __eou__ No...we want padded chairs...okay? __eou__ 
Real times. __eou__ They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin... __eou__ 
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake. __eou__ Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father. __eou__ Are you solid with that? __eou__ No. I think it's fucked. __eou__ Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here? __eou__ 
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down. __eou__ Don't ever stare him down. __eou__ I won't do it. __eou__ Don't eyeball your kids. __eou__ 
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather... __eou__ I know and I'm honored... __eou__ If anything ever happens to me... __eou__ I know... __eou__ Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little... __eou__ 
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911. __eou__ What happened? Oh my God... __eou__ 
No way. __eou__ It has to be done. __eou__ 
I want you to hear me out. __eou__ What. __eou__ You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent. __eou__ I don't think so. __eou__ We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves. __eou__ 
Have you thought about what I said? __eou__ Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please? __eou__ I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack... __eou__ I got you. __eou__ Where's the bathroom? __eou__ 
My god. __eou__ There's more. __eou__ 
Money? __eou__ Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy. __eou__ What does that mean? __eou__ 
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand. __eou__ Well, oh... __eou__ And a house. Valued at 350 thousand. __eou__ So where's that leave us? __eou__ 
So. When is the wedding. __eou__ Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow. __eou__ 
What are you talking about? __eou__ Don't sweet lip me. __eou__ I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from... __eou__ You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas. __eou__ Nothing happened in Vegas. __eou__ I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas? __eou__ 
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me? __eou__ Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing... __eou__ Shut up Boyd! Micheal? __eou__ 
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset. __eou__ I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers. __eou__ Lois please. __eou__ 
What is it? __eou__ Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there? __eou__ 
What? __eou__ I'm with Tina. Is she there? __eou__ 
She's not here. __eou__ Where is she? __eou__ She's here. She's just...Hold on a second. __eou__ 
Okay. Hi. __eou__ So who's the lucky guy? __eou__ Who? __eou__ The groom? __eou__ 
Yup. __eou__ Doing the bachelor party thing? __eou__ That's right. __eou__ Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina? __eou__ She's in the bathroom...she's still working. __eou__ She's still working? __eou__ That's right. __eou__ Sweet deal. __eou__ 
Is everything okay? __eou__ Great. Fine. Perfect. __eou__ 
She's in there! __eou__ I'm just gonna let her know I'm here. __eou__ 
No I don't. __eou__ Fish? __eou__ 
Your investment ideas never work out. __eou__ That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big. __eou__ 
I don't think so Boyd. __eou__ Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir. __eou__ 
But not tonight. __eou__ Not tonight. __eou__ 
Keith Richards, Dean Martin... __eou__ Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard... __eou__ 
Where do you look? What side of the neck? __eou__ Left side. __eou__ 
He's right. __eou__ We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground. __eou__ 
I got her arm. __eou__ Here's his head. __eou__ 
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives. __eou__ Today is the best day of the rest of our lives. __eou__ 
What's your fucking point? __eou__ I'm not talking to you? __eou__ 
What's goosed? __eou__ What is her disposition? __eou__ 
He just had two. __eou__ Give me two more. __eou__ 
He's too drunk. __eou__ He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here. __eou__ 
You said that Boyd. __eou__ Well, I didn't mean it. __eou__ 
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold. __eou__ Who's up for making some real money? __eou__ 
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs... __eou__ Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir. __eou__ 
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay. __eou__ That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars. __eou__ We need padded chairs. __eou__ Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English... __eou__ 
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party. __eou__ I can't. __eou__ 
Oh, Jesus...call the police. __eou__ No. __eou__ She's dead. Call somebody! __eou__ Shut up. __eou__ Call 911. __eou__ Shut up. __eou__ 
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys! __eou__ Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose... __eou__ 
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here. __eou__ Nobody knows. __eou__ 
Oh God. This is insane. __eou__ What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane. __eou__ 
Nobody knows she's here. __eou__ Good God...Good God... __eou__ 
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan. __eou__ I'm calling the police. __eou__ So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that? __eou__ 
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves. __eou__ I think we should say some words over the grave. __eou__ What kind of words? __eou__ I'm talking about prayer. __eou__ Go ahead. __eou__ 
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this. __eou__ No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker. __eou__ 
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives." __eou__ However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right? __eou__ 
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey. __eou__ You always were a jealous man. __eou__ 
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left... __eou__ No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking... __eou__ 
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here. __eou__ Shut up Boyd. __eou__ Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior. __eou__ He's having a problem here. __eou__ 
Easy Boyd. __eou__ No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity? __eou__ 
He's cracked up. __eou__ He is not cracking up. __eou__ Boyd...What have we done? __eou__ What did you ask me? __eou__ What? __eou__ What is the question you asked me? __eou__ I said, what have we done? __eou__ Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done? __eou__ I don't know! I just want to get married. __eou__ Say it again. __eou__ What? __eou__ What you just said. Say it again. __eou__ I just want to get married. __eou__ Exactly! Exactly my point. __eou__ 
What's your point? __eou__ You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes. __eou__ 
Regarding what? __eou__ Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police? __eou__ No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right. __eou__ 
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him. __eou__ Suck my ass. __eou__ 
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep. __eou__ I don't think that's such a good idea. __eou__ Just do it. __eou__ What are you going to do? __eou__ Take care of business. __eou__ What does that mean? __eou__ And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you? __eou__ I don't know... __eou__ You got a nasty side to your thought process. __eou__ 
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation. __eou__ What does that mean? __eou__ 
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there? __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal. __eou__ Hear what? __eou__ That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth. __eou__ Now? __eou__ 
That's right. __eou__ Isn't it a little late? __eou__ Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning? __eou__ 
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most. __eou__ I'm getting really tired of your bullshit. __eou__ My what? __eou__ You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly. __eou__ You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation? __eou__ I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things! __eou__ Okay fine. __eou__ Fine? Fine what? __eou__ Whatever you say Kojak. __eou__ I'm serious. __eou__ I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money. __eou__ 
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive. __eou__ You're sick. __eou__ And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money! __eou__ Not a prayer. __eou__ I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark! __eou__ You need help. __eou__ 
You're a fucking moron. __eou__ It's my fucking opinion. __eou__ 
The hell I did! __eou__ The hell you didn't! __eou__ The hell I did! __eou__ You said one in two marriages end in divorce. __eou__ I never heard that. __eou__ 
Nope. __eou__ Moore? __eou__ 
Your ideas never work out. __eou__ Oh really? Starbucks? __eou__ 
I don't hate women. __eou__ You hate women. __eou__ False. __eou__ True. __eou__ Not true. __eou__ You have a King fantasy. __eou__ I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night. __eou__ And what happens when you can't? __eou__ New king. __eou__ 
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see? __eou__ Israel doesn't have a King. __eou__ Then what do they have? __eou__ They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something. __eou__ I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot. __eou__ What's your point? __eou__ Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right? __eou__ The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies. __eou__ There's my point exactly. __eou__ What? What's your point? __eou__ Take Mexico. __eou__ What? __eou__ Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico. __eou__ 
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction. __eou__ They need leadership. __eou__ That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right? __eou__ 
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me? __eou__ Not really, no. __eou__ Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders. __eou__ 
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all. __eou__ You said nobody would miss her. __eou__ No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel. __eou__ 
This is going to stop right now. Right now! __eou__ You will not screw this up. __eou__ 
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know? __eou__ Ball park sausages. __eou__ You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want? __eou__ Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime. __eou__ Easy Micheal. __eou__ He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out. __eou__ 
We're goosed. __eou__ We're not goosed. __eou__ 
We're goosed! Goosed by God! __eou__ Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her? __eou__ 
Stop it! __eou__ Goosed! __eou__ 
Stop. __eou__ Goosed! __eou__ Give me the Valium. __eou__ 
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy. __eou__ How about my Fatburger? __eou__ Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me? __eou__ I love you. __eou__ 
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there. __eou__ All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything? __eou__ Are we supposed to? __eou__ It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't. __eou__ 
May we have the rings please? __eou__ What? __eou__ The rings? __eou__ 
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part? __eou__ I do. __eou__ 
This is ridiculous. __eou__ Government cutbacks. __eou__ Why can't we do it through the mail? __eou__ We missed the deadline. __eou__ Can't we do it on the phone? __eou__ I don't think so. __eou__ 
Why is this Kid staring at me? __eou__ I'm not sure. __eou__ 
Did you send in all of the deposit checks? __eou__ I think so. __eou__ What do you mean, you think so? __eou__ I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are. __eou__ The wedding cake check? __eou__ Sent it. __eou__ Photographer? __eou__ Sent it. __eou__ Florist? __eou__ Yup. __eou__ Caterer? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge... __eou__ I think I forgot the tent. __eou__ You forgot the tent? __eou__ I think so. __eou__ Why? __eou__ Why what? __eou__ Why did you forget the tent check? __eou__ I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry. __eou__ You can't play around with these tent people. __eou__ I'm not playing around. I forgot. __eou__ What else have you forgot? __eou__ How could I know what else I forgot? __eou__ I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith. __eou__ Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's. __eou__ Don't you dare. __eou__ What? __eou__ Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't... __eou__ 
Stop it. I'm sorry. __eou__ You know how important this is to my mother. You know that. __eou__ I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else. __eou__ I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks. __eou__ Are we going to do this again? __eou__ I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes. __eou__ I wouldn't know. __eou__ It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas. __eou__ They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it. __eou__ Well it's bad timing. __eou__ How do you figure? __eou__ Right before the wedding? __eou__ It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding. __eou__ I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this. __eou__ He is. __eou__ He's a moron. __eou__ He's my friend. He's not a moron. __eou__ David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas. __eou__ 
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality? __eou__ What are you talking about? __eou__ I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself. __eou__ I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth. __eou__ I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships... __eou__ Who else? __eou__ Charles Moore for instants. __eou__ You don't like Moore? Since when? __eou__ It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here. __eou__ What does Moore have to do with your growing? __eou__ I just don't see him in the big picture. __eou__ I've known him since Cub Scouts. __eou__ He's weird. __eou__ He's quiet. __eou__ He's weird. __eou__ 
He just doesn't talk a lot. __eou__ Why? What's his problem? __eou__ He's a great chef. __eou__ He's weird. And I expect more from you. __eou__ You expect more what? __eou__ You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them. __eou__ Time out. __eou__ It's vile! __eou__ 
That's absurd. __eou__ I've seen it on television. __eou__ I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body. __eou__ I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?! __eou__ You will not be common!!! __eou__ 
Do you love me? __eou__ Of course. __eou__ How much? __eou__ With all my heart. __eou__ Kiss me...? __eou__ 
We've got problems here. __eou__ Problems? __eou__ 
Seating problems. __eou__ Okay. __eou__ Keith do not trivialize this. __eou__ I'm not. What's the problem? __eou__ We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded. __eou__ What kind of seats can we have? __eou__ Not padded ones. __eou__ So what do we do? __eou__ You go down there. __eou__ Go down where? __eou__ Go down to the seat place and straighten this out. __eou__ Honey I don't have the time... __eou__ I need your help. __eou__ We're leaving in three hours. __eou__ I need your help. __eou__ I'll call them from the road. __eou__ Do you love me? __eou__ More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever. __eou__ Take care of those chairs. __eou__ We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off. __eou__ Maybe. __eou__ 
Will you please call the chair people? __eou__ I will. __eou__ Do you love me? __eou__ Of course. __eou__ Just call and let me know that your okay. __eou__ I love you. __eou__ Have a nice bachelor party. __eou__ 
Hello. __eou__ Hi. __eou__ 
Hi.  Are you calling from jail? __eou__ Not yet. __eou__ Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation? __eou__ I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you. __eou__ That's sweet. __eou__ Well I do. __eou__ Well you should. __eou__ What are you doing? __eou__ Just a bit of organizing. __eou__ Nesting? __eou__ Yeah. Nesting. __eou__ I'm mad at you. __eou__ Go have fun. Not too much. __eou__ I'll see you tomorrow... __eou__ 
Hello. __eou__ Hey. It's me. __eou__ Where are you? __eou__ We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late. __eou__ How late? __eou__ No. Just like an hour or so. __eou__ What about the chairs? __eou__ Okay. __eou__ What okay? __eou__ What! __eou__ The chairs. __eou__ I left a message. I think it's going to be okay. __eou__ You sound funny. Did you do cocaine? __eou__ No. No. I'll see you in about four hours. __eou__ 
What's the word on the chairs? __eou__ I'm working on it. __eou__ Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge. __eou__ 
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me. __eou__ "At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..." __eou__ 
This is our honeymoon. __eou__ After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house... __eou__ 
Yeah baby. Everything's great. __eou__ Well, can you come back inside? __eou__ Yeah. Sure. __eou__ Now? __eou__ Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business. __eou__ 
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations. __eou__ Are they fighting? __eou__ No baby. We'll all be right in. __eou__ 
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?! __eou__ Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying. __eou__ No way. __eou__ Can we just talk this out? __eou__ Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got... __eou__ 
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset. __eou__ We're not canceling. __eou__ I know. __eou__ I won't even discuss it. __eou__ No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back. __eou__ I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow. __eou__ Don't we already have someone to do that for us? __eou__ Yeah. You. __eou__ Okay. Okay. __eou__ 
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids. __eou__ No. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ 
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama. __eou__ No it's not okay. It's not. __eou__ 
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay. __eou__ Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off. __eou__ Don't even. __eou__ Do you love me? __eou__ What? __eou__ Do you love me? __eou__ What kind of stupid question is that? __eou__ Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We... __eou__ What are you talking about? __eou__ Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident. __eou__ Who's dead? __eou__ The prostitute. __eou__ You fucked a prostitute? __eou__ No Micheal did. It was an accident. __eou__ You killed a prostitute. __eou__ Micheal, by accident. __eou__ Call the police. __eou__ It's too late. __eou__ My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she? __eou__ She's in the desert. She's out in the desert. __eou__ You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone? __eou__ She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all... __eou__ Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned. __eou__ But... __eou__ No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses. __eou__ But... __eou__ No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water! __eou__ 
I told Boyd two fucking minutes! __eou__ What money? __eou__ 
He kept saying he was protected. __eou__ What does that mean? __eou__ Like if something happened to him, he could still get us. __eou__ Like how? __eou__ I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried. __eou__ The only proof is those bodies. __eou__ So what do we do? __eou__ Move the bodies. __eou__ Move the bodies? __eou__ 
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much... __eou__ You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too. __eou__ What? __eou__ If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over. __eou__ No... __eou__ You put him down or don't bother coming back. __eou__ But... __eou__ Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?! __eou__ 
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you... __eou__ You did all right dad. __eou__ I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am. __eou__ You never walked away dad. You could have walked away. __eou__ I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me. __eou__ Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle." __eou__ Just kills me... __eou__ I love you dad. __eou__ I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead! __eou__ 
Everything okay? __eou__ Yeah, Dad. It's great. __eou__ Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here. __eou__ OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on. __eou__ 
That's just insecurity. __eou__ I don't know. She's really been stressing out. __eou__ Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters. __eou__ What does that mean? __eou__ It means she's insecure. __eou__ About what? __eou__ 
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards. __eou__ I just want her to be happy. __eou__ Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body. __eou__ 
I'm not breathing right. __eou__ You're not breathing right? __eou__ Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes. __eou__ 
I don't care for him. __eou__ He's your brother. __eou__ So? __eou__ 
I'll take a ride. __eou__ Go for it. __eou__ Come on. __eou__ 
I'm getting married... __eou__ I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry... __eou__ 
Dear God...I don't know how to pray. __eou__ Just go ahead and say what's on your mind. __eou__ 
Where did you get that? __eou__ At the newsstand on 3rd. __eou__ 
Do you hear buzzing Fish? __eou__ Buzzing? __eou__ Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull. __eou__ I don't hear it. __eou__ Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem. __eou__ Have another drink. __eou__ 
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo". __eou__ The wahoo? __eou__ The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me? __eou__ The wahoo moment? __eou__ That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me? __eou__ I think so. __eou__ I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things. __eou__ 
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit. __eou__ No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois. __eou__ 
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just... __eou__ What is it? __eou__ Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right. __eou__ 
That ought to be about the end of that. __eou__ Yup. __eou__ 
No...No. __eou__ How do you know she's dead. __eou__ 
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head. __eou__ I got to agree with that. __eou__ 
The first day. __eou__ What? __eou__ 
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter. __eou__ Did she believe you? __eou__ I have no idea. __eou__ You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious. __eou__ Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me. __eou__ 
I'm thinking about maybe making a move. __eou__ A move? __eou__ Greenpeace. __eou__ Greenpeace? __eou__ Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim... __eou__ 
Where's Boyd? __eou__ Downstairs in the closet. __eou__ 
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his. __eou__ My God... __eou__ He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror. __eou__ Did he try to kiss you? __eou__ All week long. __eou__ 
You alright? __eou__ Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me? __eou__ I guess. __eou__ I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn." __eou__ Pup corn? __eou__ That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never. __eou__ 
There. __eou__ Where? __eou__ 
Yeah? __eou__ I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing. __eou__ That's a good one. __eou__ I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think? __eou__ 
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother. __eou__ That's what I'm thinking. __eou__ 
Well that ought to be about the end of that. __eou__ Yup. __eou__ 
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound? __eou__ I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think? __eou__ 
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out. __eou__ Okay great. What will that be? __eou__ We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic. __eou__ What song? __eou__ "You Send Me." __eou__ Oh I know that. How does it go... __eou__ You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower. __eou__ 
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part? __eou__ I do. __eou__ 
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile... __eou__ ...embarrassing, shameful... __eou__ ...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state... __eou__ The stone age. __eou__ The post-Vegas Man. __eou__ A mutant species. __eou__ Okay boys, smile! __eou__ 
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it. __eou__ Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them. __eou__ We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids. __eou__ Take your time. I wish I had. __eou__ We will. __eou__ So where to on the honeymoon? __eou__ 
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had. __eou__ That's our plan. __eou__ Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling. __eou__ 
Good times. __eou__ Drum banging real times. __eou__ 
She's dead. __eou__ It was an accident! __eou__ 
Fucking desert. __eou__ Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert. __eou__ 
Right. __eou__ That's right. __eou__ 
Shut up Micheal. __eou__ I KILLED MY BROTHER! __eou__ 
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect. __eou__ I don't think that's a good idea. __eou__ I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here? __eou__ 
I'll come to you tonight. __eou__ No, the children sleep with me. __eou__ Give them to Refugio. __eou__ No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too. __eou__ Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ... __eou__ 
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way. __eou__ You'd like me to kill them? __eou__ 
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding? __eou__ Yes, yes. __eou__ 
Stop this, stop this. __eou__ Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart. __eou__ 
Where's the camera? __eou__ It's a present from my parents. __eou__ 
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there? __eou__ Two. __eou__ Are there many windows? __eou__ Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers. __eou__ Then it's a respectable house. __eou__ 
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother. __eou__ So you didn't come from the poorhouse! __eou__ 
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill. __eou__ Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you. __eou__ 
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak. __eou__ Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn? __eou__ 
Don Amalio! __eou__ What's that? __eou__ Enedina and Paco ... __eou__ What about them? __eou__ They're playing games behind the couch ... __eou__ 
Which couch? __eou__ That one. __eou__ 
Take me there. __eou__ Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss. __eou__ 
Yes, Uncle. How are you? __eou__ I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like? __eou__ Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle. __eou__ You'll think you're still at the convent. __eou__ 
How long are you staying? __eou__ A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days. __eou__ Was that difficult to get? __eou__ No. Mother Superior told me to come. __eou__ 
Did you have so little interest in seeing me? __eou__ To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ... __eou__ You have no feelings toward ... __eou__ No. __eou__ 
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle. __eou__ In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out. __eou__ 
Come down here, you scamp. __eou__ Who is she? __eou__ My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal. __eou__ Come down. __eou__ 
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk. __eou__ I know, Uncle, you've told me that already. __eou__ You see, even the voice. __eou__ 
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water. __eou__ You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone. __eou__ Only because you want it. __eou__ 
What do you mean? __eou__ Nothing. I didn't say anything. __eou__ 
How did you know about that? __eou__ Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true? __eou__ Yes, it is. __eou__ Don't you ever see him? __eou__ Never. __eou__ How could anybody behave like that? __eou__ Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of... __eou__ Evil. __eou__ And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand. __eou__ 
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything. __eou__ And this innocent child. __eou__ Don't worry. He won't be forgotten. __eou__ 
You must think I am a monster. __eou__ No, but what a pity life is like that. __eou__ 
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death. __eou__ Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ... __eou__ 
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave. __eou__ Thank you, Uncle. __eou__ 
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell. __eou__ Whatever you like. __eou__ 
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it. __eou__ Today I can refuse you nothing. __eou__ 
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child! __eou__ I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim. __eou__ 
You must think I'm mad. __eou__ No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man. __eou__ 
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell. __eou__ Wasn't that cowardice? __eou__ No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed. __eou__ 
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you. __eou__ It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ... __eou__ 
Unfortunately ... __eou__ It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different. __eou__ Maybe ... __eou__ 
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house. __eou__ You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all. __eou__ 
Leave us alone, Ramona. __eou__ Don't go! __eou__ 
You're lying. __eou__ No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself. __eou__ 
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over. __eou__ Go away! Leave me alone. __eou__ 
Let me pass! __eou__ You must listen to me before you go. __eou__ I've listened to you long enough. Let me out. __eou__ 
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go. __eou__ You disgust me... even if what you say is true. __eou__ Then you won't forgive me? __eou__ 
Leave me now. You can go to bed. __eou__ Yes, sir. Good night. __eou__ 
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days? __eou__ I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone. __eou__ 
Sit down, I'm going to need your help. __eou__ What's the matter? __eou__ 
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you? __eou__ I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn. __eou__ Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me? __eou__ Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything. __eou__ 
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl. __eou__ But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her? __eou__ 
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her. __eou__ Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously. __eou__ What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her. __eou__ But what can I say to her, sir? __eou__ Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her. __eou__ 
You believe me, don't you? __eou__ Yes, sir. __eou__ 
Don't lie. You don't believe me either. __eou__ It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir. __eou__ 
What will the lady say? __eou__ She won't even know. __eou__ If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours. __eou__ 
Is it all right? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir. __eou__ 
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ... __eou__ I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ... __eou__ 
How much is that? __eou__ Fifteen yards. __eou__ That's fifteen by seven? __eou__ That's it. __eou__ Good. __eou__ 
Have you thought of what you want planted yet? __eou__ The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow. __eou__ It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables. __eou__ And in the vegetable plot? __eou__ That's good land. __eou__ 
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip? __eou__ No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving? __eou__ Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon. __eou__ 
Me? __eou__ Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty. __eou__ 
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor. __eou__ Do you have great devotion for the Virgin? __eou__ 
It's very good. __eou__ Thank you; but it's missing something. __eou__ That doesn't matter; I like it. __eou__ 
My God, what have you done to him! __eou__ He was asking for it. __eou__ But why? Why? __eou__ 
Ramona! Ramona! __eou__ Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ... __eou__ 
Not in that way; you're always looking for company. __eou__ Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous. __eou__ 
What's the matter with you? __eou__ Nothing. __eou__ Why the bad temper? __eou__ It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves. __eou__ 
She's mad. __eou__ No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion. __eou__ Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ... __eou__ 
So, Ramona! __eou__ Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly. __eou__ 
If you wake first, wake me up. __eou__ What are you going to do? __eou__ 
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier. __eou__ You're happy, aren't you! __eou__ 
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ... __eou__ I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do. __eou__ You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this. __eou__ 
What are you thinking about? __eou__ That your cousin is more to your taste. __eou__ 
She isn't my cousin. __eou__ It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her. __eou__ 
How in hell does it wind up? __eou__ I think I'd better go tomorrow. __eou__ Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen? __eou__ 
You see how much you like her? __eou__ That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens? __eou__ 
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ... __eou__ If you free me, you'll be a rich man ... __eou__ 
Me, rich? Come on! __eou__ There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it. __eou__ 
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money. __eou__ Where's the dough? __eou__ Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot! __eou__ 
Kill him. __eou__ That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch. __eou__ 
He was very good. Better than some people would think. __eou__ Why did he kill himself? __eou__ 
I don't know, sir. __eou__ One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I? __eou__ 
And this chest? __eou__ There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old. __eou__ 
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you. __eou__ Why? __eou__ You wouldn't be here otherwise. __eou__ These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable. __eou__ 
I don't know -- they've always been there. __eou__ That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used. __eou__ 
Miss Viridiana ... __eou__ Are you Jorge? __eou__ 
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service. __eou__ I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer. __eou__ 
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you? __eou__ It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it? __eou__ Well... is it so urgent? __eou__ If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you. __eou__ 
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ... __eou__ But you have a right to let us know what you think. __eou__ I'm not interested. Do what you think's best. __eou__ 
What do you know about me? __eou__ I know that you used to work with an architect. __eou__ And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now. __eou__ 
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much. __eou__ I'm not like you, you have your wife. __eou__ 
What are you doing here? Get out. __eou__ Leave him alone. __eou__ You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out. __eou__ Do they worry you that much, then? __eou__ They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you. __eou__ 
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others. __eou__ I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth. __eou__ Is that all you're going to devote your life to? __eou__ I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day. __eou__ 
Are they going to work here too? __eou__ Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you. __eou__ 
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning. __eou__ I'll be ready. __eou__ Do you intend to stay here for some time? __eou__ 
Yes. Why? __eou__ You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere. __eou__ 
And ...your friend? __eou__ She's left. __eou__ Is she coming back? __eou__ No. __eou__ Why? __eou__ 
It's for people! __eou__ Then let him go and he'll follow you. __eou__ And let him get run over by somebody else? __eou__ 
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed. __eou__ How much do you want for him? __eou__ I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you. __eou__ 
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs. __eou__ What's he called? __eou__ Canelo! __eou__ 
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them. __eou__ Are you sure it isn't contagious? __eou__ They told me it isn't at the hospital. __eou__ 
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy. __eou__ I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock! __eou__ 
How are you today? __eou__ Things seem to be getting better. __eou__ Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through. __eou__ 
Are your parents alive? __eou__ Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them! __eou__ Don't say that. __eou__ Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use. __eou__ 
You'll soon find out, you liar! __eou__ Stop this! __eou__ He's lying through his ass! __eou__ 
How do you do, Miss Viridiana! __eou__ Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor? __eou__ You cannot leave ... __eou__ Why not? __eou__ There's been an accident. __eou__ Where? __eou__ Come with me. __eou__ 
Why are you crying? __eou__ I'm afraid. __eou__ Don't invent stories; go to bed. __eou__ A black bull came. __eou__ A black bull! __eou__ 
It's a very big one. __eou__ Very, very? __eou__ Yes -- very, very big! __eou__ He couldn't get through the door, then? __eou__ 
He came in through the cupboard. __eou__ You little liar! Get out of here! __eou__ 
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree. __eou__ Don Jaime loved to watch me skip. __eou__ 
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories? __eou__ They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready. __eou__ 
What's going on, Moncho? __eou__ This louse is looking for trouble. __eou__ 
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here. __eou__ But, miss ... __eou__ 
You have decided to leave, Moncho. __eou__ Yes! __eou__ I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it? __eou__ 
Mother? __eou__ I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows. __eou__ All right, Mother. __eou__ 
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him. __eou__ In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him. __eou__ I don't want to leave the convent, Mother. __eou__ I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again. __eou__ 
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me. __eou__ He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana? __eou__ 
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to... __eou__ The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning. __eou__ 
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you? __eou__ Mother. __eou__ 
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately. __eou__ I had so many things to think about! __eou__ A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me. __eou__ 
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something. __eou__ I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent. __eou__ Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying? __eou__ 
Forgive me if I have offended you. __eou__ You are forgiven. Goodbye. __eou__ 
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready? __eou__ When you are, miss. __eou__ Good, then let's go! __eou__ 
Don't talk like that! __eou__ I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this. __eou__ 
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults? __eou__ I've had a gutful of this. __eou__ If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody. __eou__ 
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her. __eou__ Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them. __eou__ 
What about you, Manuel? __eou__ I'm only good at making people laugh. __eou__ That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that. __eou__ 
She looks like a sick marrow! __eou__ Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good. __eou__ 
Ask the priest, miss. __eou__ That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper. __eou__ 
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant. __eou__ Ah! Pleased to meet you. __eou__ 
How do you feel? __eou__ I have a headache. __eou__ That will soon pass. It's nothing. __eou__ 
What happened to me? __eou__ You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here. __eou__ Have I slept long? __eou__ Oh, you slept well; don't worry. __eou__ 
Hello. __eou__ Hello. __eou__ 
Good morning, Rita. How are we today? __eou__ Today, a good girl. __eou__ Could I trouble you for my glass of milk? __eou__ 
What? __eou__ Yes, yes, I saw you! __eou__ 
How did you see me? __eou__ From the terrace. __eou__ It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it? __eou__ 
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me? __eou__ No, I don't want to. __eou__ 
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies... __eou__ Can you tell us what's on the disc? __eou__ ) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it. __eou__ 
In English, please. __eou__ I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program. __eou__ 
It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late. __eou__ It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying. __eou__ Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful. __eou__ 
You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you. __eou__ Me? What did I do? __eou__ 
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else. __eou__ I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it. __eou__ Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer. __eou__ 
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate. __eou__ Why wasn't I told? __eou__ 
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android. __eou__ You mean a nanotech synthetic organism. __eou__ Whatever. __eou__ 
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back? __eou__ Catch him and your record's clean. __eou__ 
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life. __eou__ If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself. __eou__ Yes or no, Mr. Barnes? __eou__ 
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you. __eou__ But only you will know he's not human. __eou__ 
What are they doing in Los Feliz? __eou__ Madison lives two blocks from their present location. __eou__ Why would they be going there? __eou__ I don't know. __eou__ I wish we could hear them. __eou__ 
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards. __eou__ He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards? __eou__ Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards. __eou__ You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet? __eou__ 
You all right? __eou__ Why'd.. .you pull me out? __eou__ Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker, __eou__ 
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for? __eou__ He was a computer program for crissake. __eou__ You were supposed to act as if everything was real. __eou__ Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho? __eou__ Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there? __eou__ I'm getting by. __eou__ 
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days. __eou__ Don't give up, Parker. Not ever. __eou__ You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year? __eou__ What about them? __eou__ Do me a favor  keep sending them. __eou__ 
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games. __eou__ Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane. __eou__ It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee? __eou__ 
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they? __eou__ I've seen worse. __eou__ Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building. __eou__ 
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it? __eou__ If you can catch him. __eou__ 
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick. __eou__ What she's going to do is get in my way. __eou__ 
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use. __eou__ She wasn't part of the deal, Cox. __eou__ Fine  you want to stay here? __eou__ 
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene. __eou__ Their weapons missing? __eou__ Sid 6.7 is now armed. __eou__ Where's my gun? __eou__ 
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are. __eou__ You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How? __eou__ 
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did. __eou__ Then I guess we're even. __eou__ 
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head? __eou__ On my life, I promise you I will. __eou__ If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself. __eou__ 
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twentyfour citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets. __eou__ Any sign of Lindenmeyer? __eou__ None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next? __eou__ Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure. __eou__ In other words, we collectively don't know shit. __eou__ 
I should have told him. __eou__ Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality? __eou__ I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think. __eou__ You think he's smart? __eou__ Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming. __eou__ 
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way. __eou__ I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent? __eou__ I need your help-- __eou__ 
Why didn't anybody tell me?! __eou__ I don't set policy.  You have the key? __eou__ 
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach. __eou__ Got it. __eou__ 
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me? __eou__ We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment. __eou__ What's the assignment? __eou__ You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field. __eou__ 
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter? __eou__ Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous. __eou__ Not if you're with him every step of the way. __eou__ The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again. __eou__ I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you. __eou__ 
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive. __eou__ Only because I got pulled out early. __eou__ Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do. __eou__ 
Think you can do it? __eou__ Not from in here. __eou__ This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release. __eou__ 
What happens if I can't catch him? __eou__ If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence. __eou__ How do you know I won't run? __eou__ 
Barnes, where the hell have you been?! __eou__ Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been? __eou__ What did you find out? __eou__ Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards. __eou__ It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is? __eou__ No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing? __eou__ Enough to level an entire city block. __eou__ If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel. __eou__ Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where... __eou__ Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena. __eou__ You know how much man power you're talking about? __eou__ You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to. __eou__ 
This better not be a wild goose chase. __eou__ Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today? __eou__ Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell. __eou__ 
What did Cox pull him out early for? __eou__ Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember? __eou__ Don't remind me. __eou__ 
What the hell happened? __eou__ Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real. __eou__ Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world. __eou__ I was assured the problem was corrected. __eou__ 
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene. __eou__ Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage. __eou__ 
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me? __eou__ The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism. __eou__ Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing. __eou__ I'm still making adjustments... __eou__ You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired. __eou__ I'M WHAT?! __eou__ You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood? __eou__ I understand... I understand perfectly. __eou__ 
How does he know who I am? __eou__ He hears...everything. __eou__ As a matter of fact, I do. __eou__ 
HEY!!! __eou__ Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours. __eou__ I haven't been working on anything. __eou__ Do I get to see it or not? __eou__ Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. __eou__ 
Get that fucking thing away from me! __eou__ You're...such a wimp. __eou__ 
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea. __eou__ It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules... __eou__ Coordinated by polymer neural net. __eou__ It feels so.. .real. __eou__ It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine. __eou__ This is supposed to be years away. __eou__ As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away. __eou__ How do you kill it? __eou__ Separate the character module from the neural net... __eou__ 
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones. __eou__ Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is. __eou__ I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you... __eou__ 
You need a maid. __eou__ What I need is a nymphomaniac. __eou__ 
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world. __eou__ What's wrong with Parker? __eou__ How should I know? __eou__ Show me his physical sensory level. __eou__ 
I wonder how that... __eou__ Turn it down! __eou__ 
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance. __eou__ Talk so I can understand. __eou__ If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR. __eou__ Then fix it. __eou__ 
Don't be angry with me, Daryl. __eou__ Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away? __eou__ Should I have? __eou__ Think hard -- it'll come to you... __eou__ 
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity! __eou__ True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime. __eou__ It was you, wasn't it? __eou__ It was me, what? __eou__ You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired! __eou__ I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive. __eou__ My God... __eou__ Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away. __eou__ What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here? __eou__ I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours? __eou__ 
She's some of your finest work, Daryl. __eou__ All my work is my finest. __eou__ 
You catching my drift? __eou__ I think I understand what you have in mind... __eou__ 
SID  NO!!! __eou__ What do you expect me to do, thank him? __eou__ 
I am beautiful, aren't I? __eou__ Of course you are. __eou__ 
How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl? __eou__ Help me get out of here. __eou__ Glad to... __eou__ 
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing? __eou__ I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please! __eou__ Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever... __eou__ 
You actually listen to all those tapes? __eou__ No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today? __eou__ A little less than yesterday. __eou__ In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday? __eou__ John died. __eou__ I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation. __eou__ You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you. __eou__ That's not true, Parker. __eou__ If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence. __eou__ What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy? __eou__ Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more. __eou__ You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target... __eou__ Go to hell. __eou__ It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved. __eou__ Enough! __eou__ 
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand. __eou__ I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that. __eou__ 
I don't need a babysitter. __eou__ What you need is a collar. __eou__ 
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie. __eou__ It wasn't a lie. __eou__ Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it. __eou__ 
You all right? __eou__ Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar. __eou__ 
You ready for this? __eou__ Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody. __eou__ 
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders. __eou__ Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene. __eou__ Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done. __eou__ Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends. __eou__ I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7? __eou__ I know who would know. __eou__ 
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file? __eou__ He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin. __eou__ What happened when he was 17? __eou__ Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here. __eou__ 
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun? __eou__ Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it. __eou__ 
What are you doing? __eou__ Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you? __eou__ You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think? __eou__ 
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work. __eou__ Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him... __eou__ 
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me. __eou__ I'm still working on it. __eou__ 
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains? __eou__ I've been in prison, remember? __eou__ The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho. __eou__ Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one... __eou__ 
I am the demon from the bottomless pit... __eou__ ... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977. __eou__ I am impressed. __eou__ For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ. __eou__ Who said that? __eou__ Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7? __eou__ He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite. __eou__ 
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain. __eou__ Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts. __eou__ But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones. __eou__ 
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you. __eou__ As a matter of fact, it is. __eou__ 
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality? __eou__ Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile. __eou__ What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else. __eou__ In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick... __eou__ 
Give me your wrist. __eou__ Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone. __eou__ And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist. __eou__ 
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere. __eou__ How did you get your hand out? __eou__ 
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter? __eou__ I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life. __eou__ She's beautiful, you know? __eou__ Thank-you.  Her name is Karin. __eou__ 
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house? __eou__ I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes. __eou__ You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to? __eou__ Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming. __eou__ What does that mean? __eou__ Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve. __eou__ Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next. __eou__ What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before. __eou__ Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee. __eou__ 
I forgot what real coffee tastes like... __eou__ You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant... __eou__ Don't worry about it, all right? __eou__ Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I... __eou__ Relax. I know what you meant. __eou__ I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them. __eou__ Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while? __eou__ 
Don't get out of the car. __eou__ Stop me. __eou__ 
What the hell's going on?! __eou__ This is my area of expertise. __eou__ 
What did you do to those people? __eou__ Nothing. __eou__ 
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it? __eou__ Enjoying yourself? __eou__ You know I am. __eou__ This isn't a game, Parker! __eou__ Tell him. __eou__ 
What's the problem? __eou__ I'm doing the best I can! __eou__ 
Whatever he was doing here was only the start. __eou__ Start of what? __eou__ I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished... __eou__ 
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media. __eou__ You like baseball? __eou__ 
Real effective security... __eou__ You could have just flashed him your badge, you know? __eou__ Authority still makes me nervous. __eou__ 
Which way? __eou__ Both. __eou__ 
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you __eou__ If you're gonna do it, better do it now. __eou__ 
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!! __eou__ No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself! __eou__ 
We know you didn't kill those guards. __eou__ They're going to fry me for it, anyway. __eou__ 
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did. __eou__ You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now? __eou__ 
How did you find out about the toxin? __eou__ Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him. __eou__ You're not capable of it. __eou__ I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember? __eou__ I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again. __eou__ 
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think? __eou__ I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious. __eou__ Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes. __eou__ Part of him is. __eou__ 
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind. __eou__ Think he's keeping track of his creation? __eou__ That, or living through him... __eou__ 
See something? __eou__ I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone... __eou__ 
Nice work. __eou__ Thanks. __eou__ 
Find out anything? __eou__ A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where. __eou__ 
Can I ask you something? __eou__ You mean there's something you haven't asked me? __eou__ You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this? __eou__ You don't know? __eou__ That's why I'm asking. __eou__ Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7. __eou__ 
You okay? __eou__ ...I think so...You? __eou__ More or less. __eou__ Lindenmeyer? __eou__ My guess is dead. __eou__ Sid? __eou__ I don't know. __eou__ 
Where the hell are you going? __eou__ Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had... __eou__ 
How's your pulse? __eou__ I couldn't tell you. __eou__ Then shoot him already. __eou__ Duck! __eou__ 
What do we do now? __eou__ You won't want to watch. Turn around. __eou__ 
Where's John? __eou__ Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far? __eou__ 
The symphony of collision... __eou__ The only thing I want to hear is your silence. __eou__ I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common  we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends. __eou__ 
You and me have nothing in common. __eou__ Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands? __eou__ 
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!! __eou__ Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends. __eou__ GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD! __eou__ 
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to? __eou__ DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? __eou__ You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me. __eou__ 
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you __eou__ Why's that? __eou__ 
What C-4...was Cox talking about? __eou__ Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night. __eou__ Where did you plant the C-4?! __eou__ 
What C-4...was Cox talking about? __eou__ Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night. __eou__ Where did you plant the C-4?! __eou__ 
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?! __eou__ My...secret. __eou__ 
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale. __eou__ I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it? __eou__ 
There you go  best seat in the house. __eou__ You are going after Mayor Bennett. __eou__ Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally... __eou__ 
Aren't you going to watch with me? __eou__ I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly. __eou__ 
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport. __eou__ What are you talking about? __eou__ I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty! __eou__ 
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend? __eou__ BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD! __eou__ 
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes. __eou__ As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well. __eou__ As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month. __eou__ Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow. __eou__ Do they have to look so...robotic? __eou__ At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about? __eou__ 
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi.... __eou__ Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to... __eou__ 
...tonight... __eou__ You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President... __eou__ What if he's busy tonight? __eou__ <u>Lure</u> him.  __eou__ What are you saying... __eou__ Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way... __eou__ ...on the way in. __eou__ When you...  What?  I'm busy. __eou__ It's the White House. __eou__ <u>Hello</u>.  What? __eou__ 
What about it? __eou__ For Schumann. __eou__ Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent.  We bring'em back <u>tomorrow</u>, the charts go up, they don't go <u>down</u>... __eou__ 
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't.... __eou__ You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right? __eou__ 
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically... __eou__ We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.  Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA. __eou__ You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is.... __eou__ It's <u>producing</u>. __eou__ No, this is great. __eou__ I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant, __eou__ 
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>...  __eou__ Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb... __eou__ 
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing... __eou__ Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>... __eou__ ...but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash... __eou__ 
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>... __eou__ ...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of...  __eou__ King, we've got to be on the streets in... __eou__ 
NY Times, Washington Post, War, War, War.  Times got the girlscout page twelve, Post in Section Two.... Horses in Mid-Stream...? __eou__ I don't think you're gonna need it. __eou__ Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer. __eou__ They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone. __eou__ What can it hurt. __eou__ What can it hurt is they offend me. __eou__ 
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do. __eou__ I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...? __eou__ Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of <u>paper</u>... __eou__ 
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because... __eou__ Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...? __eou__ 
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico."  __eou__ ...can we have a white one...? __eou__ Can we have a white one, please... __eou__ 
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening... __eou__ Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code? __eou__ 
...this is a snappy song.... __eou__ What'd ya think? __eou__ 
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and... __eou__ All we have to do now is sell it to the President. __eou__ 
Mr. President, this is St... __eou__ Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya... __eou__ 
...mmm? __eou__ It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>... __eou__ Izzat the thing... __eou__ Indeed it is. __eou__ 
...The Albanian Campaign... __eou__ ...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh... __eou__ We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...." __eou__ Wilfred, that's not bad. __eou__ 
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long? __eou__ ...twelve years. __eou__ Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?" __eou__ 
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod... __eou__ ...and... __eou__ And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."? __eou__ Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication. __eou__ What happens if he doesn't have his medication? __eou__ He's not fine. __eou__ 
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it... __eou__ You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"...  __eou__ Oh, Lord.... __eou__ 
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>. __eou__ Come on. __eou__ ...where? __eou__ Come on. __eou__ 
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down. __eou__ Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u> __eou__ 
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or... __eou__ No, no, no... __eou__ 
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...? __eou__ ...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching. __eou__ <u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>. __eou__ But how do we explain the fact he was in prison? __eou__ How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of.... __eou__ 
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig. __eou__ What rig? __eou__ ...the Harvester...  __eou__ 
Naa, fuck this, this is nothing.  Oh, Lord -- this just got <u>Big</u>.  I see it -- <u>Big</u> -- Big for <u>you</u> and big for <u>me</u>. __eou__ What are you talking about? __eou__ You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal... __eou__ He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe.  __eou__ And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...? __eou__ 
Who we got here...? __eou__ John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off.... __eou__ Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know. __eou__ When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean. __eou__ Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous. __eou__

Oh, MiGod. __eou__ Guess who <u>I</u> am. __eou__ I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who... __eou__ I know who you are, Mr. Ames. __eou__ I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>... __eou__ Quite touching. __eou__ And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present. __eou__ Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War. __eou__ 
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any... __eou__ Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh... __eou__ And I think that the Security of the Country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.

The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making. __eou__ CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making  __eou__ AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH. __eou__ From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents... __eou__ ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND. __eou__ 
But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group?  __eou__ CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP. __eou__ ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. __eou__ It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three... __eou__

THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH __eou__ Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we... __eou__

This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day. __eou__ BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE. __eou__ 
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN. __eou__ ..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash.... __eou__

I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good.  __eou__ ...what is this? __eou__ 
Would somebody wake me in five minutes? __eou__ Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?

If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us... __eou__ We're locked into Albania. __eou__ Well, let's not be too sure, why is that? __eou__ The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour. __eou__ 
Hello...? __eou__ Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro... __eou__ 
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight. __eou__ Where is he? __eou__ Out in Oklahoma. __eou__ 
Well, c'n we get him back home? __eou__ Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather. __eou__ 
We're due at Andrews.  __eou__ Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to... __eou__ 
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...? __eou__ Heavy weather East of here. __eou__ Whaddaya think? __eou__ Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it... __eou__ 
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television. __eou__ N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done? __eou__ My name is Ronald Brean. __eou__ Who're you working for? __eou__ Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you. __eou__ S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be. __eou__ S'only got to hold for another few days. __eou__ Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for." __eou__ What <u>are</u> you interested in?  __eou__ I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean. __eou__ 
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job. __eou__ I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing? __eou__ 
What's on your mind? __eou__ I have a question for you. __eou__ Ask it. __eou__ Why do people go to war? __eou__ Why do people go to war? __eou__ I'll play your silly game. __eou__ Why do they go to War? __eou__ To preserve their Way of Life. __eou__ Would you go to War to do that?  __eou__ I have. __eou__ Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours.  __eou__ 
It can be documented that he displayed the... __eou__ This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny. __eou__ There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period... __eou__ 
...why? __eou__ ...you the Press Office? __eou__ ...Yes. __eou__ Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick... __eou__ ...Good... __eou__ 
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout? __eou__ Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here... __eou__ 
Is there a press conference today? __eou__ What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ... __eou__ 
But there isn't a B-2 bomber. __eou__ Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly? __eou__ Dartmouth __eou__ Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing... __eou__ 
China. __eou__ When's he coming back...? __eou__ Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today. __eou__ Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow. __eou__ 
Trade Re1ations. __eou__ You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber.  __eou__ There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber, __eou__ That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>, __eou__ 
How much...? __eou__ And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis." __eou__ 
Do I know you? __eou__ We have some mutual friends in Washington. __eou__ 
And you're here <u>why</u>...? __eou__ I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party. __eou__ Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now. __eou__ 
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action. __eou__ ...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>. __eou__ If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we... __eou__ Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ... __eou__ 
What do you want the kid to say? __eou__ Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.' __eou__

Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here. __eou__

The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building. __eou__ Is that true? __eou__ How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point? __eou__ ...going to War... __eou__ It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>... __eou__ I never won an Oscar. __eou__ N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars... __eou__ Yes.  Indeed I did.  __eou__ You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...

You can't have a war without an enemy. __eou__ No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...

Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight. __eou__ Please, no thanks...  __eou__ Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old. __eou__ Oh really. __eou__ I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink? __eou__ 
Grand Marnier. __eou__ Sounds like a french word, what is it? __eou__ It's a romantic and tragic drink. __eou__ Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away... __eou__ 
... That's what you told us to say. __eou__ Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem? __eou__ 
He's lying. __eou__ Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome. __eou__ 
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it. __eou__ Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying! __eou__ Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales. __eou__ I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history... __eou__ Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me. __eou__ 
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room? __eou__ I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you. __eou__ 
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch. __eou__ No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going. __eou__

I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv. __eou__ Yeah, where's your machine gun. __eou__ Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what? __eou__ 
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest. __eou__ Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare. __eou__ 
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today. __eou__ Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me. __eou__ Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie. __eou__ 
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone... __eou__ Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something? __eou__ 
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short. __eou__ Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko? __eou__ It concerns his future! __eou__ Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life. __eou__ 
...well, see him? __eou__ Yeah, but he didn't see me. __eou__ Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle. __eou__ 
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say? __eou__ ...gotta read my reports. __eou__ Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there. __eou__ 
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan? __eou__ Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today.  __eou__ 
Got a little action there, eh buddy? __eou__ Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant! __eou__ 
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar. __eou__ Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality... __eou__ Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for? __eou__ All right, I owe you one Marv. __eou__ That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton. __eou__ 
What the hell... __eou__ Anacott Steel. Buy it. __eou__ 
What's going on? __eou__ Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota. __eou__ 
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk. __eou__ Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here? __eou__ Hey the door was open. __eou__ Then get out and close it behind you. __eou__ You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours. __eou__ Get the hell out! __eou__ 
I agree. Go thou and sin no more. __eou__ I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it. __eou__ Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders. __eou__ 
The stock's going to Pluto! __eou__ Start unloading. __eou__ Sell? __eou__ Now! Tell everyone to dump! __eou__ 
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti... __eou__ It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date. __eou__ 
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me. __eou__ Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss. __eou__ Speak English will ya. __eou__ D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me. __eou__ I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer, __eou__ Coulda been a contender. __eou__ you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman. __eou__ Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm. __eou__ You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman. __eou__ Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline. __eou__ I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it? __eou__ 50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes... __eou__ So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you... __eou__ It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see...  __eou__ It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need? __eou__ Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise. __eou__ 
...Got a 100 on me, you... __eou__ Not in here Dad... please. Later. __eou__ 
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow... __eou__ How's Mom? __eou__ 
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it. __eou__ ...Work okay? __eou__ ...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right. __eou__ 
That's great Dad. __eou__ Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now. __eou__ Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad... __eou__ 
You sure about this FAA announcement? __eou__ About what? __eou__ The FAA announcement. __eou__ Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that. __eou__ 
What brings you out here... __eou__ Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the... __eou__ Don't start, alright. __eou__ Alright. Why so pissed? __eou__ Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money? __eou__ 
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred. __eou__ Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes... __eou__ ...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans. __eou__ Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit. __eou__ What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes. __eou__ 
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks. __eou__ ... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner? __eou__ Whatever night you like. __eou__ Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday. __eou__ Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here. __eou__ ...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear? __eou__ 
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants... __eou__ I met them before you were born. __eou__ 
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it. __eou__ No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself. __eou__ What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet. __eou__ That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim. __eou__ Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father. __eou__ 
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent... __eou__ Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please. __eou__ I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them! __eou__ Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me? __eou__ 
Your words, not mine... __eou__ You speak for me, son. __eou__ 
Another cup of coffee? __eou__ No, thanks, I'm nervous enough. __eou__ I guess it's time to hit the road. __eou__ Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral. __eou__ 
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it. __eou__ Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others... __eou__ 
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me... __eou__ What are you doing here? __eou__ ...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko. __eou__ First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday? __eou__ 
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get. __eou__ Stay here, I'll see what I can do. __eou__ 
...thanks Natalie. __eou__ ...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on. __eou__ 
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas? __eou__ No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made... __eou__ 
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought... __eou__ What'd you tell him? __eou__ I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into... __eou__ Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment. __eou__ What if he asks where I got the money? __eou__ Tell 'em your father gave it to you. __eou__ What if they call him? __eou__ They won't. That's not their jurisdiction. __eou__ You sure? __eou__ Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing. __eou__ I don't know anything! __eou__ Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry. __eou__ 
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's. __eou__ Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in? __eou__ Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out. __eou__ We are? __eou__ 
So, where are we going? __eou__ Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite. __eou__ 
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like? __eou__ Like? Uh...hmmm. Well... __eou__ I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud? __eou__ Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield... __eou__ 
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share. __eou__ So you're hot on this stock? __eou__ It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you. __eou__ 
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you? __eou__ Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie? __eou__ Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal? __eou__ Nah, she asked the wrong question. __eou__ What was that? __eou__ "What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt. __eou__ So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer? __eou__ Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over. __eou__ Okay. __eou__ What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal? __eou__ Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you? __eou__ Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another. __eou__ Yeah, right... __eou__ Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know. __eou__ ...and if I did, what's in it for moi? __eou__ 
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer? __eou__ Too much to do...but I'll walk you out. __eou__ 
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger. __eou__ All right, Bud... let's do it. __eou__ 
So what's the problem? __eou__ ...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy... __eou__ ....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this... __eou__ Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright... __eou__ Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool. __eou__ 
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come? __eou__ He never told me... __eou__ You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on. __eou__ 
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox. __eou__ So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these?  __eou__ 
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me. __eou__ Oh no, no... __eou__ Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor. __eou__ I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you... __eou__ So what firm you with, pal? __eou__ Jackson, Steinem... __eou__ ...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal. __eou__ ...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff. __eou__ ...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know? __eou__ Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko. __eou__ So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here? __eou__ 
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management. __eou__ It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport? __eou__ 
...rings a bell somewhere. So what? __eou__ A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities... __eou__ ...don't like airlines, lousy unions... __eou__ There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know. __eou__ 
How do you know? __eou__ I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop. __eou__ 
My home number's on the back... __eou__ Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one. __eou__ 
Hi sport. __eou__ Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko. __eou__ 
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen... __eou__ ...I can't even see it... __eou__ ...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today. __eou__ Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell... __eou__ Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office. __eou__ No sir, that would've been illegal... __eou__ Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account? __eou__ 
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner. __eou__ ...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious. __eou__ Excuse me sir. __eou__ 
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake... __eou__ Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on. __eou__ ...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself... __eou__ 
Nice club, Mr. Gekko... __eou__ Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people! __eou__ Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand. __eou__ 
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company. __eou__ What? How do you know about my father? __eou__ The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that? __eou__ Yes... __eou__ 
Know the name? __eou__ 'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders. __eou__ Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight. __eou__ I remember that deal. You were involved? __eou__ 
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired... __eou__ I don't understand. __eou__ Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture... __eou__ Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it? __eou__ Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business... __eou__ 
What about hard work? __eou__ What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...?? __eou__ 
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more. __eou__ Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand? __eou__ 
I'll be right there, fix them a drink. __eou__ ...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill. __eou__ You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now. __eou__ My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow. __eou__ ...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up. __eou__ 
Sorry, Mr. Gekko. __eou__ Allright. Wait here... __eou__ 
I guess I'll head back... __eou__ Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox. __eou__ 
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80. __eou__ But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72. __eou__ 
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs. __eou__ "All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate. __eou__ You're learning, sport... __eou__ 
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out. __eou__ Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%. __eou__ You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on. __eou__ ...Gordon. __eou__ Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work. __eou__ 
Got him at an auction in Kentucky. __eou__ How much? __eou__ Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals. __eou__ 
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned... __eou__ I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money... __eou__ 
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers... __eou__ Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker... __eou__ 
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune! __eou__ I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake. __eou__ Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside. __eou__ What does that mean? __eou__ The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air... __eou__ What makes you think you can? __eou__ I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts. __eou__ Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more... __eou__ 
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt. __eou__ A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox. __eou__ 
Now, wait a minute, Dad... __eou__ Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain. __eou__ 
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning. __eou__ I'm sorry, this can't wait. __eou__ 
What the hell do you want? __eou__ I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why? __eou__ 
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung. __eou__ Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me. __eou__ You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place. __eou__ Why do you need to wreck this company? __eou__ Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind. __eou__ If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word. __eou__ It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life. __eou__ Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough? __eou__ Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest. __eou__ How much is enough Gordon? __eou__ The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you... __eou__ Obviously... __eou__ 
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien... __eou__ ...I can't make it tonight. __eou__ Are you with me Buddy? __eou__ 
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide. __eou__ Dump it. __eou__ 
Hello Bud. __eou__ Gordon. __eou__ You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh? __eou__ 
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks. __eou__ Excuse me. __eou__ Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink. __eou__ Oh yes, I remember you. __eou__ Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together. __eou__ Aha. Poet or philosopher? __eou__ Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this? __eou__ 
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week. __eou__ ...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me. __eou__ Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June. __eou__ You could have a great beach house for that. __eou__ Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration. __eou__ Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here. __eou__ Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray. __eou__ I gather you're a decorator. __eou__ You got it, a great spender of other people's money. __eou__ Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place. __eou__ Where is it? __eou__ Upper West Side. __eou__ Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant. __eou__ Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo. __eou__ 
What if I have a previous engagement? __eou__ Break it. __eou__ I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie. __eou__ You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you. __eou__ 
So. See you Friday. __eou__ You really do believe in destiny? __eou__ Only if I want something bad enough. __eou__ 
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown? __eou__ He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper. __eou__ How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five. __eou__ 
If I could have anything... this would almost do. __eou__ Yeah, almost... __eou__ 
So, how did your conference go with Gordon? __eou__ The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us. __eou__ You have modest wants. I like that in a man. __eou__ And what do you want? __eou__ ...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything... __eou__ Well, why stop at that? __eou__ I don't. __eou__ You're not trouble by any chance. Are you? __eou__ 
...isn't it perfect! __eou__ ...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it.  __eou__ 
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn. __eou__ I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio. __eou__ Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable. __eou__ 
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone... __eou__ I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise. __eou__ You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection. __eou__ That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside... __eou__ 
Do you think you're ready? __eou__ It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far. __eou__ I'll let you know. __eou__ 
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching... __eou__ ...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours. __eou__ You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker. __eou__ 
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours? __eou__ Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much. __eou__ 
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side. __eou__ You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler... __eou__ ...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded... __eou__ So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy? __eou__ Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride. __eou__ 
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen. __eou__ Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people... __eou__ Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision. __eou__ I'm not gonna let it happen Darien. __eou__ 
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing. __eou__ At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger. __eou__ 
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud! __eou__ I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko. __eou__ I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life. __eou__ What the hell's that supposed to mean? __eou__ 
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien... __eou__ You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before... __eou__ I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see. __eou__ 
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes... __eou__ Get the hell out! __eou__ 
Hi. __eou__ Why? __eou__ I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own... __eou__ 
How you doing Buddy? __eou__ Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin... __eou__ 
Morning Buddy, you look happy. __eou__ Any better and I'd be guilty. __eou__ You were never that innocent sugarpie. __eou__ ...how do you know? You wish... __eou__ 
Bud! Where you been the last two days? __eou__ ...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent... __eou__ 
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital... __eou__ Oh Christ! __eou__ 
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry... __eou__ Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it. __eou__ 
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours. __eou__ Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it. __eou__ Old values. Buy. __eou__ 
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel. __eou__ No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out. __eou__ You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things. __eou__ Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud. __eou__ It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy.  __eou__ 
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does. __eou__ ...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim. __eou__ 
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here? __eou__ Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you? __eou__ 
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen. __eou__ There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know. __eou__ I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb? __eou__ No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ... __eou__ 
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground. __eou__ ...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day... __eou__ 
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine. __eou__ Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago. __eou__ Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought. __eou__ 
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love? __eou__ It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up. __eou__ Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power. __eou__ It's over you, Gordon. __eou__ You told him about us? __eou__ No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?... __eou__ 
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal. __eou__ Now tell me, why would I want to do that? __eou__ Because I don't want to see him hurt. __eou__ Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay? __eou__ I can't...and I won't. __eou__ Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit. __eou__ Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon. __eou__ You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows. __eou__ You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill. __eou__ Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of. __eou__ 
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way! __eou__ You got it, G.G. __eou__ 
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red. __eou__ He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake. __eou__ 
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag. __eou__ Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie. __eou__ And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada. __eou__ Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card? __eou__ 
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured. __eou__ Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel. __eou__ The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid... __eou__ No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers... __eou__ 
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline... __eou__ I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment. __eou__ 
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50. __eou__ Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night. __eou__ 
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing? __eou__ Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut. __eou__ 
Are you prepared to put that in writing? __eou__ I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days. __eou__ 
Cards are on the table. What do you think? __eou__ If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people. __eou__ 
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar. __eou__ You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it. __eou__ 
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest! __eou__ We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko. __eou__ 
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night __eou__ With Mark? __eou__ He still likes you __eou__ Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink? __eou__ He did? __eou__ Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady. __eou__ Businessman? __eou__ Businessman! __eou__ Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care. __eou__ Yeah, yeah, OK __eou__ Yeah  __eou__ So why are you dating Jonathan? __eou__ 
But? __eou__ But he still has something Mark hasn't. __eou__ What's that? __eou__ A body.  I mean we're talking major body __eou__ 
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big. __eou__ Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke __eou__ 
Anybody want another drink? __eou__ It's eleven forty-five let's go __eou__ 
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what? __eou__ About what?  About us. __eou__ Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it. __eou__ Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'. __eou__ A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French. __eou__ I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok? __eou__ Yeah well why should I suffer for that? __eou__ Suffer?  We're living in America. __eou__ 
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way? __eou__ Ok toots, I will. __eou__ 
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok. __eou__ China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much. __eou__ 
Weird and tiny huh? __eou__ Hi __eou__ 
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too. __eou__ Hmm. __eou__ Would you like a closer look? __eou__ It's all rather morbid though isn't it? __eou__ 
Yes, I guess you're right __eou__ Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look? __eou__ 
Your books Master Loftmore __eou__ Thank you Jenkins __eou__ And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir __eou__ Thank you __eou__ And uh, your nicotine sir __eou__ Thank you __eou__ Allow me sir __eou__ 
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir? __eou__ Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air __eou__ Have a nice day  sir __eou__ 
We're all here, and ready sir! __eou__ Jenkins! __eou__ Good evening sir. __eou__ 
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help? __eou__ Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards! __eou__ 
Hello? __eou__ Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there? __eou__ No Jonathan. __eou__ No? __eou__ She went to a waxwork party __eou__ A party at a waxwork huh? __eou__ Can I give her a message? __eou__ You don't happen to have the address do ya? __eou__ 
Velcome to ve Vaxverk. __eou__ Uh, wrong picture Tony. __eou__ 
I hope you enjoyed your visit. __eou__ Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable. __eou__ Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh. __eou__ They seemed, closing by much  __eou__ Tony and China? __eou__ Vell.  Goodnight. __eou__ 
Haven't we been doing our homework. __eou__ I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that. __eou__ 
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home. __eou__ What?  Tony and China, together? __eou__ Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head. __eou__ I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok. __eou__ 
Then why do you still like her? __eou__ Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get. __eou__ I know what you mean. __eou__ 
No Mark. MARK Why not? __eou__ I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive. __eou__ Come on. __eou__ No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else. __eou__ 
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends. __eou__ That's not what you said last night. __eou__ Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional. __eou__ A little? __eou__ 
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing! __eou__ Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man. __eou__ Oh that explains everything. __eou__ You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on. __eou__ Big deal! __eou__ 
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me. __eou__ Who's is all this? __eou__ 
Well? __eou__ Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork. __eou__ 
Well, it all started when a friend and I __eou__ China __eou__ 
Sarah listen to me. __eou__ Go away. __eou__ 
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night __eou__ Forget her Mark, she's a bitch __eou__ 
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room. __eou__ Safety in numbers man. __eou__ Right. __eou__ 
Anyone else not coming? __eou__ Right behind you. __eou__ 
This time I really don't see anyone man. __eou__ Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display. __eou__ This. is killer. __eou__ 
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred. __eou__ Hi there Sarah __eou__ 
No thank you sir we're fine. __eou__ So Mark, what's so urgent? __eou__ Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them __eou__ 
Well? __eou__ Well divide 18 into three __eou__ Six six and six __eou__ 
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either __eou__ Sell my soul? __eou__ Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out? __eou__ You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple. __eou__ Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life! __eou__ 
Can this be stopped? __eou__ Maybe before the event, never after. __eou__ 
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy. __eou__ Mom. __eou__ One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us' __eou__ They're all human beings __eou__ Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared __eou__ Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'? __eou__ Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college __eou__ Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning? __eou__ When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you __eou__ But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY __eou__ I'll think about it.  Now run along darling. __eou__ 
Stop saying things so loud! __eou__ Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it! __eou__ 
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain __eou__ You guys are being real assholes __eou__ 
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people  __eou__ Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays __eou__ YES! __eou__ 
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this? __eou__ Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first. __eou__ 
Do you have a scarf? __eou__ Hey. __eou__ 
Yes? __eou__ It's only two hours away. __eou__ I know that. __eou__ I'll come back all the time. __eou__ Of course you will. __eou__ I'm just saying, you're going to be fine. __eou__ 
That was very good. __eou__ Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right. __eou__ Why? __eou__ 
Besides, Dad would have freaked. __eou__ No, he wouldn't. __eou__ I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing. __eou__ That's not true. __eou__ Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is. __eou__ 
He loves you very much.  He just-- __eou__ I know he does. __eou__ 
Are you mad at me? __eou__ Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother. __eou__ 
I miss you. __eou__ So much. __eou__ It got so bad your father almost had to put me away. __eou__ What do you mean? __eou__ I started seeing things. __eou__ A ghost? __eou__ 
Did you? __eou__ No.  But once I heard... __eou__ What? __eou__ Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy. __eou__ Then we both are. __eou__ 
Who's idea was it? __eou__ Mine.  His.  We both...thought... __eou__ 
I didn't want to come. __eou__ Then why did you? __eou__ Because he was worried about me. __eou__ Your husband? __eou__ Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace. __eou__ Do you really think so? __eou__ No. __eou__ 
Why is he worried? __eou__ Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard? __eou__ 
Fireball? __eou__ You're joking. __eou__ 
These are good. __eou__ Mm-hmm. __eou__ 
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll. __eou__ How do you know it's a she? __eou__ I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub. __eou__ What does she look like? __eou__ Pretty.  She's a blond. __eou__ Do you have any idea who she is? __eou__ Um...I'd rather not say...just yet. __eou__ Fine. __eou__ What do you think I should do? __eou__ 
What? __eou__ Try to communicate with her somehow. __eou__ You think that'll help? __eou__ Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants. __eou__ 
Are you humoring me? __eou__ Nope. __eou__ 
How? __eou__ I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle. __eou__ 
What's happening to me? __eou__ Well, that's what we're here for. __eou__ 
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern. __eou__ Yes, but... __eou__ Your friend saw them. __eou__ Isn't there something called group hysteria? __eou__ You think you influenced her? __eou__ Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became. __eou__ You're saying you willed these events to happen? __eou__ I don't know, I'm very confused right now. __eou__ 
She said, "You know."  That I know. __eou__ Do you? __eou__ No. __eou__ What do you think?  Guess. __eou__ 
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my-- __eou__ Have you been hurt? __eou__ Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but... __eou__ You were in an accident? __eou__ Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman. __eou__ 
What? __eou__ That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me. __eou__ That can't feel good. __eou__ No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist. __eou__ 
Of course.  You must be so proud. __eou__ I am. __eou__ Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity. __eou__ 
How're you holding up? __eou__ Just fine.  It's a lovely party. __eou__ 
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished. __eou__ Almost. __eou__ Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well. __eou__ 
I'm sorry? __eou__ I know how hard it can be sometimes. __eou__ 
Uh-huh.  What can be? __eou__ Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year. __eou__ 
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst. __eou__ No.  I'm just not sure what you mean. __eou__ There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned. __eou__ At the party. __eou__ Toward the end.  You remember? __eou__ Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine. __eou__ Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know. __eou__ Who's that? __eou__ The wives. __eou__ 
Yes? __eou__ Um... __eou__ I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase. __eou__ Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door. __eou__ This really isn't a good time. __eou__ 
Well maybe your wife... __eou__ She isn't here. __eou__ When...when will she be back? __eou__ I don't know. __eou__ Oh-kay... __eou__ I have to go. __eou__ 
Who? __eou__ Give me that shit.  Your wife. __eou__ I didn't kill my wife. __eou__ 
Who are you? __eou__ It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything-- __eou__ You're the flower lady. __eou__ Um...yes. __eou__ I've seen you.  From the window. __eou__ Is everything alright? __eou__ 
Hello? __eou__ I'm not... __eou__ 
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath... __eou__ Who?  Your husband? __eou__ And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of... __eou__ 
What?  What are you afraid of? __eou__ I can't, no, no, I can't... __eou__ 
Tell me.  Please. __eou__ That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear. __eou__ 
Tell me.  I can help you. __eou__ How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life... __eou__ That's not...It's not like that. __eou__ I've never even met you. __eou__ I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school. __eou__ This fence...it's so... __eou__ I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you... __eou__ 
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please... __eou__ Wait!  Don't go... __eou__ 
I wanted to apologize. __eou__ You do? __eou__ For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day... __eou__ And then you weren't there. __eou__ Right.  I'm sorry. __eou__ 
Would you like some iced tea? __eou__ Very much. __eou__ 
Your house is so beautiful. __eou__ Thank you. __eou__ And these roses.  They're much prettier up close. __eou__ 
No. __eou__ Of what?  What were you so afraid of? __eou__ You're going to think I'm crazy or something. __eou__ 
Love. __eou__ What? __eou__ Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave? __eou__ Um...sure. __eou__ I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home. __eou__ 
You must think I'm pathetic. __eou__ No.  No, I don't. __eou__ I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends. __eou__ 
Mrs. Frank? __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ I'd like to talk to you about Madison. __eou__ You know where she is? __eou__ No, I don't. __eou__ Please leave me alone. __eou__ 
What's your name? __eou__ Claire. __eou__ She never mentioned you. __eou__ 
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense. __eou__ It's fine. __eou__ 
You look a little old for a student. __eou__ I'm not.  We...we met at a party. __eou__ Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it. __eou__ She never mentioned her father. __eou__ Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that. __eou__ 
Why are you here? __eou__ I don't know. __eou__ It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened. __eou__ 
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close. __eou__ You must have been very proud. __eou__ 
They're calling me in to work. __eou__ I should be going anyway. __eou__ 
Y'hear anything you'll let me know? __eou__ Of course. __eou__ 
What was her major? __eou__ Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor. __eou__ 
Wow. __eou__ This is... __eou__ We know each other. __eou__ 
He looked like one of the Monkees. __eou__ Anyway, Claire slept with him... __eou__ I didn't sleep with him. __eou__ ...just so she could cut them off. __eou__ He was so pissed. __eou__ I came in from my room... __eou__ We were suite mates. __eou__ And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish. __eou__ Oh God... __eou__ 
You should have heard her play. __eou__ Stop. __eou__ We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open. __eou__ Do we have to? __eou__ And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried. __eou__ She's making this up. __eou__ I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks. __eou__ 
She got it.  Turned it down. __eou__ I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night... __eou__ 
How you holding up? __eou__ Good.  I'm good. __eou__ You are? __eou__ Why does everyone find that so surprising? __eou__ Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping... __eou__ Okay, I'm a little tender. __eou__ Well good.  So you're human. __eou__ And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club. __eou__ Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this. __eou__ 
What is it? __eou__ Kambucha mushroom tea... __eou__ Jody-- __eou__ It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring-- __eou__ You're discussing me with your psychic? __eou__ She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit. __eou__ Thanks, but I'm fine. __eou__ So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different? __eou__ 
Oh my god.  You bought it. __eou__ Yep. __eou__ It's niiice. __eou__ Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes? __eou__ Absolutely. __eou__ Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning? __eou__ You got it. __eou__ 
You think he killed her? __eou__ I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be? __eou__ 
Know what I think? __eou__ What? __eou__ Seance. __eou__ Jody, no... __eou__ Telling you... __eou__ ...no...no...no... __eou__ Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija. __eou__ Please.  That's all I need. __eou__ 
Someone's there. __eou__ What? __eou__ In the window.  Norman's at work. __eou__ I don't... __eou__ 
Wow.  I'm losing it. __eou__ No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly. __eou__ 
Sit down here. __eou__ Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee? __eou__ 
Place your fingers on the planchette. __eou__ The planchette? __eou__ This. __eou__ 
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name? __eou__ I don't know. __eou__ 
Nothing's happening. __eou__ Shhh. __eou__ 
Oh... __eou__ M-E... __eou__ 
Mef?  What's Mef? __eou__ It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her. __eou__ 
I have to go. __eou__ Jody, wait. __eou__ 
Are you okay? __eou__ I think so __eou__ I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire... __eou__ It's alright. __eou__ I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen. __eou__ 
Does Norman know? __eou__ Jody, she's alive. __eou__ What? __eou__ Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet. __eou__ Then what was it? __eou__ Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just-- __eou__ Something was there.  You saw it. __eou__ Did I? __eou__ Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford... __eou__ Hartford? __eou__ And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours. __eou__ No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now. __eou__ But Claire-- __eou__ Please. __eou__ 
Okay.  Okay. __eou__ I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you. __eou__ 
Oh God...you knew. __eou__ I was down in Adamant... __eou__ Adamant? __eou__ Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe. __eou__ 
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't. __eou__ Why? __eou__ Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved. __eou__ Relieved? __eou__ I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed. __eou__ 
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late. __eou__ Too late?  Jody, it was an accident. __eou__ Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system? __eou__ 
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away. __eou__ All of us. __eou__ 
I'm a terrible friend. __eou__ No. __eou__ 
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself? __eou__ What are you going to do? __eou__ I don't know. __eou__ If she was dangerous before-- __eou__ She could have hurt me if she wanted to. __eou__ You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection. __eou__ No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace. __eou__ 
Jody, she tried to kill him. __eou__ I know. __eou__ I can't believe this is happening. __eou__ We need help.  Please let me call the medium. __eou__ That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead. __eou__ 
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it. __eou__ Like what? __eou__ I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up... __eou__ What is it? __eou__ 
But he acted like he'd never heard of it. __eou__ Did he say that? __eou__ Jody he was lying. __eou__ What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start? __eou__ I guess not. __eou__ He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too. __eou__ 
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters. __eou__ I don't know... __eou__ Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go. __eou__ 
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in? __eou__ I think three... __eou__ Three weeks. __eou__ 
What's their name? __eou__ Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic. __eou__ 
She's awake. __eou__ We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet. __eou__ 
When's she out of here? __eou__ Norman Spencer. __eou__ 
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class. __eou__ Don't. __eou__ Claire, I have to show up for the-- __eou__ It's Saturday. __eou__ 
It's today? __eou__ Yep. __eou__ 
Claire? __eou__ Three o'clock. __eou__ 
Whatcha reading? __eou__ Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms. __eou__ How is it? __eou__ 
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell. __eou__ Nice.  Almost done. __eou__ 
If you have to work... __eou__ No, no.  I'm just about...  There. __eou__ 
How are you? __eou__ Fine. __eou__ It's okay if you're not. __eou__ I am, really. __eou__ It's just she's been the focus for a while. __eou__ Not the focus. __eou__ You know what I mean. __eou__ 
To tell you the truth...I'm excited. __eou__ You are... __eou__ To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us. __eou__ 
You did a great job.  She's a good kid. __eou__ We did. __eou__ 
It's just us now. __eou__ I know. __eou__ 
Tired? __eou__ Nope. __eou__ Wanna fool around? __eou__ Yup. __eou__ 
Did you... __eou__ Shhh. __eou__ 
And we moved out here for the quiet. __eou__ Mmm. __eou__ 
Maybe we should just... __eou__ Tomorrow. __eou__ I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan. __eou__ After that. __eou__ I'll be there. __eou__ 
Of what? __eou__ Of him I think. __eou__ Did she say that? __eou__ More or less. __eou__ 
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds. __eou__ I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice... __eou__ Remember how we were? __eou__ Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can-- __eou__ Why? __eou__ To make sure she's all right. __eou__ 
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of-- __eou__ That's not what I'm sug-- __eou__ ...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake. __eou__ But what if something happens? __eou__ Claire... __eou__ I'd never be able to live with mysel-- __eou__ Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is... __eou__ I know. __eou__ It's what I've been working for. __eou__ 
I just wish you could have heard her. __eou__ Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out. __eou__ Promise? __eou__ 
Norman, you have to look at this! __eou__ Mmnph. __eou__ Hurry... __eou__ 
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something. __eou__ Is it gone? __eou__ 
Hi. __eou__ I'm stuck here for another couple of hours. __eou__ 
Oh. __eou__ Unless you need me to come home... __eou__ No, no.  It's fine. __eou__ 
Claire? __eou__ Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time. __eou__ 
What are you doing here? __eou__ There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you. __eou__ 
What do you mean?  Some noises where? __eou__ In the house.  I was scared. __eou__ Did you call the police? __eou__ No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning. __eou__ Of course. __eou__ 
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering. __eou__ What kind of whispering? __eou__ I don't know.  Just...whispering. __eou__ 
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe. __eou__ I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day? __eou__ 
Think I may have cracked it. __eou__ Really? __eou__ 
I think so.  Maybe. __eou__ You are so brilliant. __eou__ Yep. __eou__ Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer... __eou__ You know what that does to me. __eou__ 
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway... __eou__ You're kidding. __eou__ He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us... __eou__ Wow. __eou__ 
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..." __eou__ Well, that's nice. __eou__ "...especially Spencer's Theorem..." __eou__ Oh, no... __eou__ "...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say... __eou__ That's... __eou__ "...for my father." __eou__ I'm so sorry. __eou__ Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe. __eou__ That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some. __eou__ Did you tell her? __eou__ What?  No.  No. __eou__ You didn't? __eou__ Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't. __eou__ 
Sorry.  You understand. __eou__ Did you call about the Feurs? __eou__ Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly. __eou__ Huh. __eou__ 
Get down!  He'll see. __eou__ What's going on, Claire? __eou__ Shhhh. __eou__ 
He killed her. __eou__ What? __eou__ He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one. __eou__ And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic-- __eou__ No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this. __eou__ 
Our house. __eou__ No.  Look!  In the window. __eou__ 
It's a flare. __eou__ A flare? __eou__ From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass. __eou__ It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me! __eou__ It's a ghost. __eou__ 
Where is she then? __eou__ She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know. __eou__ Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this. __eou__ 
See? __eou__ What am I looking at? __eou__ I didn't do that. __eou__ Who did?  Mrs. Feur? __eou__ Maybe.  Point is...not me. __eou__ Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him? __eou__ She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but-- __eou__ Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed? __eou__ Dressed? __eou__ Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl. __eou__ When? __eou__ What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since... __eou__ Oh. __eou__ ...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this? __eou__ Tonight? __eou__ Yes, tonight.  We're going to be-- __eou__ 
When you do this, I swear... __eou__ ...Don't get all... __eou__ ...like it never even happened... __eou__ Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just... __eou__ 
What are you doing? __eou__ Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late. __eou__ Five minutes? __eou__ 
You're not at the center. __eou__ I know I'm not at the center of the bridge. __eou__ We're going to be fine. __eou__ 
There we go. __eou__ Well, that's a relief. __eou__ 
I don't need a shrink. __eou__ Harvey says he's amazing. __eou__ Norman... __eou__ What can it hurt to talk to someone? __eou__ 
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong. __eou__ I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something... __eou__ I never said... __eou__ ...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up. __eou__ 
Are you lonely? __eou__ No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist! __eou__ 
What are you doing out here? __eou__ He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and-- __eou__ This is the Feur thing? __eou__ Yes.  And he's going to get away with it. __eou__ 
How do you know this? __eou__ We had a seance. __eou__ Who did? __eou__ Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave. __eou__ How did you-- __eou__ Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her. __eou__ 
What? __eou__ Maybe you resent how busy I've been. __eou__ What are you...?  No. __eou__ You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow. __eou__ Sabotage? __eou__ Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or... __eou__ The accident...? __eou__ But then you've been so much better... __eou__ Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not... __eou__ Sweetheart-- __eou__ No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you. __eou__ 
Keep your voice down. __eou__ I will NOT. __eou__ 
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind... __eou__ Claire, please... __eou__ 
I'm sorry... __eou__ Then where is she? __eou__ 
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay? __eou__ No, it's fine.  I'm fine. __eou__ Really big bed. __eou__ 
Do I have everything? __eou__ Yep. __eou__ Call ya later. __eou__ 
What? __eou__ Are you glad?  I'm glad. __eou__ 
You know I am. __eou__ Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there... __eou__ 
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving... __eou__ I felt you...looking through me... __eou__ We walked all night... __eou__ You told me that I was... __eou__ 
You don't remember? __eou__ When she said it, there was something familiar...but no. __eou__ 
You dropped a glass. __eou__ I... __eou__ A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you... __eou__ In the living room... __eou__ You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home. __eou__ But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely-- __eou__ It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time. __eou__ But I don't remember. __eou__ Sweetheart, it was over a year ago. __eou__ What's wrong with me? __eou__ 
I may have seen her on campus. __eou__ Not personally. __eou__ No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about. __eou__ It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen. __eou__ The... __eou__ Yes.  The ghost. __eou__ 
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not... __eou__ Stop... __eou__ ...I'm positive this time... __eou__ ...Please stop... __eou__ It's Madison Fra-- __eou__ STOP IT! __eou__ 
I take it your not mad at me. __eou__ Wouldn't go that far. __eou__ 
Ow! __eou__ What's the matter? __eou__ It's too rough. __eou__ Since when? __eou__ 
I don't like this, this... __eou__ Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor. __eou__ 
I think she's starting to suspect something. __eou__ Who? __eou__ Your wife... __eou__ STOP IT! __eou__ 
"You know..." __eou__ What? __eou__ 
I was there. __eou__ Claire-- __eou__ I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house. __eou__ Oh God... __eou__ I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now. __eou__ 
It was last year.  We were having troubles. __eou__ So you fucked a student?! __eou__ That's not what I'm sayi-- __eou__ DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go! __eou__ 
Claire, please don't... __eou__ What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music... __eou__ I never asked you to quit! __eou__ ...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family... __eou__ 
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her. __eou__ Who? __eou__ To Caitlin!! __eou__ 
Leave her out of this! __eou__ And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive... __eou__ Stop... __eou__ ...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped. __eou__ I'm not going to listen to this. __eou__ 
I tried to break it off! __eou__ You should have tried harder. __eou__ Claire... __eou__ Get out of my way. __eou__ 
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house... __eou__ How did she know where it was? __eou__ 
She did it. __eou__ We don't know that for sure. __eou__ Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be? __eou__ 
We have to get out of here. __eou__ It's alright. __eou__ Can't you see, she's trying to kill us. __eou__ She's gone. __eou__ What? __eou__ She can't be here without me. __eou__ How can you be sure? __eou__ I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it. __eou__ Claire... __eou__ 
The leaves... __eou__ Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast. __eou__ Look for antiques... __eou__ Yep.  There's some great places nearby. __eou__ Adamant. __eou__ What? __eou__ Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming. __eou__ Huh. __eou__ Do you know it? __eou__ Don't think so. __eou__ Maybe we can stop there for lunch. __eou__ 
What's that for? __eou__ Nothing. __eou__ I'm cooking you dinner. __eou__ You don't have to do that. __eou__ I know. __eou__ Fine.  I'll do the shopping. __eou__ 
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake. __eou__ Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is. __eou__ Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed! __eou__ I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have-- __eou__ I don't believe you. __eou__ IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think! __eou__ 
Mmmuh... __eou__ Shhhh. __eou__ Mauduh... __eou__ 
What? __eou__ MADISON! __eou__ 
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when? __eou__ :No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true. __eou__ :Would you stop it! __eou__ :Well, they are. __eou__ :What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now? __eou__ :Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way. __eou__ 
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith. __eou__ Then what is he...? __eou__ A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence. __eou__ 
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now. __eou__ Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it! __eou__ 
Thank you for this honor, my dear. __eou__ You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away. __eou__ I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both. __eou__ 
I have seen him again.  Last night. __eou__ But you've not told Michael. __eou__ 
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like - __eou__ Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me. __eou__ 
Are you alright...?  You look pale. __eou__ I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor. __eou__ 
There are two. __eou__ Two what...? __eou__ Two heartbeats. __eou__ 
With his hands! __eou__ But why would they do that...? __eou__ 
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan! __eou__ But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him. __eou__ Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?! __eou__ 
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho-- __eou__ Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess. __eou__ 
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...? __eou__ With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday. __eou__ Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family. __eou__ 
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours. __eou__ You sound certifiable. Yon know that. __eou__ 
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did. __eou__ Come.  There is a lot to read __eou__ 
A what...? __eou__ A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him. __eou__ 
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...? __eou__ There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...? __eou__ Rowan. __eou__ Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael. __eou__ 
Don't tell Rowan about this. __eou__ Michael, Rowan should - __eou__ NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...? __eou__ 
What have the witches always asked of you...? __eou__ "Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..." __eou__ Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could... __eou__ 
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life. __eou__ Nothing was ever more false. __eou__ Then tell me.  Is it Lasher.... __eou__ 
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...? __eou__ Every day  twice. __eou__ 
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start! __eou__ What are you talk--- __eou__ He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child! __eou__ 
Rowan... __eou__ You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back! __eou__ 
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together. __eou__ I want to see my mother. __eou__ 
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life. __eou__ He made that quite clear, yes. __eou__ Gifford - that box glued to your hands...? __eou__ 
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common. __eou__ Nothing worse than a common tool. __eou__ 
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...? __eou__ Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer. __eou__ In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll. __eou__ 
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure - __eou__ I don't want it. __eou__ 
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens. __eou__ Then you wear it. __eou__ C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition. __eou__ 
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere. __eou__ It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time. __eou__ 
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party. __eou__ In certain cases, hell is the operative word. __eou__ Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things __eou__ 
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding. __eou__ I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...' __eou__ Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches! __eou__ Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch! __eou__ 
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be - __eou__ Hello...?  Who is this...? __eou__ Who is this...? __eou__ Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...? __eou__ I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair. __eou__ 
I beg your par--- __eou__ When did she die...? __eou__ Who is this...? __eou__ This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans. __eou__ 
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who - __eou__ Diedre Mayfair was your mother. __eou__ 
My...mother...? __eou__ Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate - __eou__ But my mother...  Ellie said she died - __eou__ I under5tand.  All the same __eou__ -Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when - __eou__ I had you sent away. __eou__ Who the hel1 - __eou__ It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great - __eou__ What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?! __eou__ A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer - __eou__ When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!! __eou__ Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the - __eou__ I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?! __eou__ 
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear. __eou__ I want to see my mother.  Where is she...? __eou__ In the coffin, my dear.  where else...? __eou__ 
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?! __eou__ A Mayfair it ever I saw one. __eou__ I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every - __eou__ I'm tired.  I need to rest. __eou__ There are things I have to know! __eou__ 
I don't want the - __eou__ Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now. __eou__ Eighty million doll --- ? __eou__ And this - if you decide to take the rest. __eou__ 
What is it...? __eou__ The lamplight.  That's all. __eou__ 
You can see well in the dark, Rowan. __eou__ Better than most, I suppose. __eou__ Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead- __eou__ 
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?. __eou__ She didn't feel them __eou__ You're a monster. __eou__ 
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon. __eou__ Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!! __eou__ You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...? __eou__ 
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm. __eou__ 'He'...? __eou__ 
Lasher touched you and you loved it. __eou__ It wes a dream...! __eou__ Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile! __eou__ Stop it! __eou__ Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are. __eou__ ENOUGH!!! __eou__ 
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her... __eou__ You're mad!  Your mind is sick! __eou__ ...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires - __eou__ You - are - a - murderer. __eou__ But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...? __eou__ 
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...? __eou__ I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel - __eou__ 
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us - __eou__ Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice... __eou__ 
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back __eou__ The door, Michael.  find the key... __eou__ Help us.  Do what you can. __eou__ 
Michael...  Do what you can. __eou__ Michael...  Help us...  The door! __eou__ 
Lasher - bring us through! __eou__ Now, lasher - it is our time. __eou__ 
Parents say he - uh - fell - __eou__ Anybody got a BP yet...? __eou__ 
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his - __eou__ FAST. __eou__ uh - then he - be just - __eou__ He just went out like & light- __eou__ 
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now. __eou__ I'll tell OR we're bringing - __eou__ He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray -  Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down! __eou__ 
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...? __eou__ Lie...? __eou__ There are things you will not tell him. __eou__ 
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More... __eou__ Like this...? __eou__ 
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be. __eou__ Nooo...  NO!  Stop! __eou__ 
STOP! __eou__ Always loved you.. __eou__ 
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me. __eou__ I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now. __eou__ YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT! __eou__ Explain this to me --- violated...? __eou__ You bastard... __eou__ 
Made it...? __eou__ It is from love. __eou__ To love, you must be able to feel. __eou__ If you knew how I yearn for that... __eou__ 
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel... __eou__ It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...? __eou__  __eou__ 
You're very clever, aren't you...? __eou__ I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...? __eou__ 
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever --- __eou__ I bring her flowers too. __eou__ 
There is no one here but the dead. __eou__ Go away!  I don't want you here. __eou__ If that were true, I would not be here. __eou__ It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants. __eou__ From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child... __eou__ 
A girl...? __eou__ It's too soon to know. __eou__ 
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can. __eou__ What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand. __eou__ But I could understand. I want to understand! __eou__ I LOVE him! __eou__ Do not tell me that! __eou__ I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!! __eou__ 
I know that you're evil. __eou__ I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien... __eou__ And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?! __eou__ No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me. __eou__ 
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me! __eou__ But have I...?  Ever...?! __eou__ 
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat. __eou__ I love Michael... __eou__ Then help me--- for his sake... __eou__ 
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt.. __eou__ Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me... __eou__ Only you... __eou__ Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything... __eou__ 
Go on. Rowan.  Go on. __eou__ Leave me alone! __eou__ 
What is wrong...? __eou__ Wrong...?  Science is not magic. __eou__ I do not understand... __eou__ You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?! __eou__ There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am. __eou__ I don't know what you are!!! __eou__ That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am. __eou__ 
No! __eou__ Tell me what I am, Rowan. __eou__ 
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...? __eou__ It was an accident.   Gifford, too. __eou__ 
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now! __eou__ They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter... __eou__ 
Oh god... __eou__ Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life. __eou__ 
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone. __eou__ No!   Don't!  Lasher!!! __eou__ 
Put - him - down!  His - his heart... __eou__ How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...? __eou__ 
Let me go...  Michaelllllll... __eou__ ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone! __eou__ I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a - __eou__ 'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...? __eou__ 
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever. __eou__ I know.    you are my son - __eou__ 
Harder... __eou__ Rowan... __eou__ Harder... __eou__ Like this...  LIKE THIS...? __eou__ Yessss... __eou__ Always loved you. Rowan.  Always... __eou__ 
They like you ------- kids. __eou__ I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office... __eou__ 
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage. __eou__ 'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are.. __eou__ 
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...? __eou__ I'm glad you're around to say it. __eou__ My jury's still out on that, __eou__ Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..? __eou__ 
Do they keep everything 'out' ...? __eou__ As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it. __eou__ 
What do you see...? __eou__ Nothing.  Absolutely nothing- __eou__ 
Just one.  The bar's closed. __eou__ The one time I want it to work... __eou__ You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body - __eou__ You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody - __eou__ No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things. __eou__ 
Harder... __eou__ Rowan... __eou__ HARDER! __eou__ Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?! __eou__ Yessssss... __eou__ 
you're very --- different. __eou__ I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you. __eou__ 
What else did you see- Michael...? __eou__ What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.? __eou__ 
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year. __eou__ You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you... __eou__ 
It's unbelievable that you can do that. __eou__ It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away- __eou__ 
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that. __eou__ And whose houses do you design...? __eou__ Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands... __eou__ You still feel that crazy...? __eou__ 
I was born, in New Orleans, too- __eou__ Really...?  Your family there...? __eou__ Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born. __eou__ 
Too much... too fast...? __eou__ Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame. __eou__ 
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings. __eou__ He fools around with his patients too. __eou__ 
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...? __eou__ It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...? __eou__ 
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters. __eou__ Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha! __eou__ 
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence. __eou__ Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah. __eou__ 
Why don't you let at do that...? __eou__ Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D. __eou__ Doctor's orders- - -? __eou__ Captain's orders. __eou__ 
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there. __eou__ All I meant was - __eou__ You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me. __eou__ 
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know - __eou__ Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...? __eou__ I'm serious.  You don't - __eou__ Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really - __eou__ Stop it. __eou__ You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work. __eou__ 
Seems more like a year than a month. __eou__ Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created... __eou__ 
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned. __eou__ God knows, I'm intriguing. __eou__ Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...? __eou__  __eou__ You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you. __eou__ 
We're quite a pair, you and I. __eou__ Mad. for each other. __eou__ 
Hello...? __eou__ Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying - __eou__ Rowan...? __eou__ Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael... __eou__ What's wrong..? __eou__ 
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I - __eou__ What about you coming down here...? __eou__ 
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there. __eou__ Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...? __eou__ Goodbye, Michael.   I love you. __eou__ 
You know...? __eou__ I know.  It's not possible --- but I know. __eou__ 
She - she said I - I was a --- __eou__ - a witch. __eou__ 
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe - __eou__ Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger. __eou__ Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY. __eou__ Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...? __eou__ 
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho--- __eou__ He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?! __eou__ 
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan! __eou__ But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...? __eou__ 
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here. __eou__ Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night! __eou__ I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want - __eou__ 
Do you love me, Michael...? __eou__ Yes.  I love you.  Very much. __eou__ I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you. __eou__ 
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune. __eou__ I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch. __eou__ 
What about your work back home...? __eou__ They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money! __eou__ 
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile. __eou__ Let's see. __eou__ 
You sure...? __eou__ It's the next best thing to being there' - right...? __eou__ 
Everyone - this is Michael curry. __eou__ Hello.. __eou__ Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff--- __eou__ 
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up. __eou__ He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in. __eou__ Maybe he's just - waiting... __eou__ If we married, we'd shut him out forever. __eou__ 
Ro, how long have we known each other. __eou__ I don't think of us that way - ever. __eou__ Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU.  __eou__ Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes. __eou__ 
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...? __eou__ No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know. __eou__ 
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael. __eou__ Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor. __eou__ 
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house. __eou__ And I thought I was the mindreader. __eou__ 
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay. __eou__ That's GREAT! __eou__ Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...? __eou__ 
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence - __eou__ Their what...? __eou__ So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...? __eou__ 
Wanna snack...? __eou__ A little wine...? __eou__ 
Hey - you're bleeding. __eou__ Dropped it. __eou__ 
You look a little green. __eou__ Mm-hmmm... __eou__ Maybe the shrimp you bad last night. __eou__ Mm-hmm... __eou__ 
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore __eou__ Mm-hmm... __eou__ 
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis... __eou__ Did you see the old man on the --- __eou__ Michael! __eou__ 
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...? __eou__ No.    This is unreal... __eou__ It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you. __eou__ I love you too. __eou__ 
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin. __eou__ That's cause we're below sea level. __eou__ ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself. __eou__ That's not funny. __eou__ 
You did that, didn't you...? __eou__ Talking to me dear...? __eou__ 
Remember the first time we made love - and then --- __eou__ - we made a fire. __eou__ 
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...? __eou__ Your beneficence. __eou__ I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...? __eou__ 
You alright...? __eou__ A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...? __eou__ 
Is he - is he gonna die...? __eou__ Lock the door.  Lock it __eou__ 
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...? __eou__ I don't know. __eou__ 
If it's a boy --- Taylor. __eou__ A bit much.    Lucas. __eou__ Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson. __eou__ Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy. __eou__ 
When aid you get home last night...? __eou__ What were you talking about...? __eou__ Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic.    Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't - __eou__ 
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old. __eou__ Go ahead. __eou__ 
Something's wrong with you. __eou__ Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you. __eou__ 
Hi. __eou__ Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...? __eou__ I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic - __eou__ Gotcha. __eou__ 
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to. __eou__ It's not true.  You have to believe me. __eou__ 
I can't. __eou__ That's not good enough.  Why not...?! __eou__ I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't! __eou__ 
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there! __eou__ Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave. __eou__ Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..? __eou__ Stop it! __eou__ How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...? __eou__ You bastard! __eou__ 
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!! __eou__ Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me - __eou__ No. __eou__ 
Lasher...  Where --- where is --- __eou__ It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone. __eou__ 
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do. __eou__ I just - hate it when they're - finished. __eou__ 
Go home, Stu  I'll call you. __eou__ Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont. __eou__ On which planet...? __eou__ You can't just - __eou__ Go away, GODDAMNIT! __eou__ 
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...? __eou__ The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point. __eou__ 
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...? __eou__ That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...? __eou__ 
Wow... __eou__ If you like that type. __eou__ 
You okay...? __eou__ Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...? __eou__ 
I'm getting --- left behind. __eou__ Left behind...?  This about Rowan...? __eou__ Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in --- __eou__ 
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance. __eou__ Just don't fall off any ladders. __eou__ 
Rowan Mayfair. __eou__ Sut McKinley.  Marry me. __eou__ I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...? __eou__ You really love this guy...? __eou__ He's got great hands. __eou__ Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves. __eou__ I like him.  He can stay. __eou__ 
I thought it was 'whistle while you work. __eou__ Is that a crack about our singing...? __eou__ Is that what you were doing...? __eou__ 
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...? __eou__ Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof. __eou__ 
We'd better get to work on the papers. __eou__ Papers...? __eou__ Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into - __eou__ I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder. __eou__ 
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could - __eou__ No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction. __eou__ That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash. __eou__ I plan on liquidating almost evetything. __eou__ 
Which do you think is her best shot... __eou__ The one on the left - definitely... __eou__ Don't give me shit - what do you want? __eou__ 
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off? __eou__ As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY? __eou__ 
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated. __eou__ You know that circulation is down for three months in a row. __eou__ I heard something like that __eou__ Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for... __eou__ 
OH MY GAWD! __eou__ I'm sorry - I didn't think __eou__ A person could get killed round here just for working late __eou__ 
I thought you were someone else __eou__ Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for? __eou__ 
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK? __eou__ Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time. __eou__ 
Sounds good - thank you __eou__ Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me? __eou__ 
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE __eou__ CHIC MAGAZINE? __eou__ Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round. __eou__ 
When could I look round? __eou__ Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points... __eou__ 
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...? __eou__ BRIAN... __eou__ But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later? __eou__ 
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN __eou__ Yes it is... __eou__ Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key? __eou__ Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock __eou__ So there is only one key... __eou__ That's right... __eou__ And it can't be forged? __eou__ I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then. __eou__ 
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job __eou__ No -it's no problem - I do it all the time __eou__ All the time? __eou__ No - not all the time - I mean __eou__ I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening... __eou__ 
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time __eou__ No - I've been abroad for a long time... __eou__ 
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know __eou__ Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer. __eou__ I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember? __eou__ I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory... __eou__ 
This must be one of the old keys - __eou__ Yes - I have had it for years. __eou__ 
It doesn't mention 'females only' __eou__ I really don't know what to say __eou__ 
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN? __eou__ Sure... __eou__ Tell me - ELLEN CARTER  Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'? __eou__ 
I lost the touch __eou__ The touch? __eou__ 
Do you take sugar? __eou__ Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book __eou__ 
What are you doing? __eou__ I'm sorry? __eou__ What's with all the locks - and hammering __eou__ It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA? __eou__ 
My names isn't ANGELA... __eou__ Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN... __eou__ Don't worry - Is that my hammer  Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage... __eou__ 
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen __eou__ I think I will pass... __eou__ 
Sugar? __eou__ Yes, one and a half please. __eou__ 
So what do you do? __eou__ I'm a dentist __eou__ And how long have you been a dentist? __eou__ 
Oh, about six years since I graduated __eou__ And how many people have you killed? __eou__ I don't know __eou__ You don't know? __eou__ No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't __eou__ Where do you kill them... __eou__ Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of __eou__ my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why? __eou__ I don't know __eou__ Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more - __eou__ Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore? __eou__ No she didn't... __eou__ What did you do with her? __eou__ You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them!  __eou__ 
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE? __eou__ I don't want to talk about it - __eou__ OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair... __eou__ I don't know... __eou__ Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white? __eou__ I don't know... __eou__ Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE? __eou__ Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from? __eou__ 
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed __eou__ Why should I feel sorry - they're dead. __eou__ 
How long have you been watching me? __eou__ I have something I have to show you... __eou__ 
Tell me about your wife... __eou__ My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me... __eou__ then why did you marry her - __eou__ It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband. __eou__ 
What didn't you like about her? __eou__ I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came __eou__ 
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league __eou__ I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer. __eou__ You've killed but you're not a killer __eou__ That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick - __eou__ 
Tell me how it happened... __eou__ Why should I? __eou__ Why not? Please - it would help me __eou__ 
And how did it feel to be rid of him __eou__ Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him __eou__ 
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted __eou__ Tell me about your adopted MOTHER __eou__ 
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you? __eou__ Did you? __eou__ 
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother. __eou__ STEPHANIE? __eou__ My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER - __eou__ Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER? __eou__ STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me... __eou__ 
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE? __eou__ It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me... __eou__ 
I want it to stop - it all to stop... __eou__ Then make it stop... __eou__ 
What? __eou__ I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me... __eou__ Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons __eou__ Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now... __eou__ 
What's wrong? __eou__ Nothing could be better... __eou__ 
What's wrong? __eou__ I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful... __eou__ 
What is it? __eou__ Open it... __eou__ 
Yes... __eou__ You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought... __eou__ But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped... __eou__ But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round... __eou__ 
Where are you going? __eou__ Out - I may be some time __eou__ 
We've got nothing to talk about __eou__ LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think __eou__ 
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face... __eou__ I am sorry... __eou__ 
LESLIE?  Is that good enough? __eou__ Yes - I suppose so... __eou__ 
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot __eou__ No thanks -  __eou__ 
First finish your tea... __eou__ He doesn't need to... __eou__ 
Why did you let him in? __eou__ What was I supposed to do? __eou__ 
I don't like sugar __eou__ There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea? __eou__ It's not that - I just don't want any sugar __eou__ Why whats wrong with the sugar - __eou__ 
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE __eou__ CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning? __eou__ 
whats wrong...what have I done wrong? __eou__ Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait... __eou__ WAIT FOR WHAT!? __eou__ 
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please... __eou__ You killed my friend! __eou__ 
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this? __eou__ It's what you would do to me __eou__ 
Don't you want me now LESLIE __eou__ No - I'll have you after __eou__ 
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due? __eou__ At 2.00... __eou__ 
Well, what do you think? __eou__ I don't know - it's your house ELLEN __eou__ Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house? __eou__ I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly. __eou__ 
What's wrong with you? __eou__ I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE __eou__ What? __eou__ You heard me - keep away from him __eou__ 
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him! __eou__ Yes I can... __eou__ 
I want you out now __eou__ Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are? __eou__ I'm your landlady __eou__ 
What happened? __eou__ I had an accident - I fell down stairs... __eou__ Is LESLIE here? __eou__ No he had to - he's just - he's out... __eou__ He saved my life you know - has he told you... __eou__ 
It's been what, three years? __eou__ What's this all about? __eou__ So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN? __eou__ 
What brings the rats out of the sewers? __eou__ I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five... __eou__ You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL? __eou__ 
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you? __eou__ At home alone - where were you? __eou__ As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems? __eou__ Get out... __eou__ 
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her. __eou__ I think you had better leave __eou__ 
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery... __eou__ Surgery? Are you a doctor? __eou__ No - a dentist __eou__ 
Just put it in my room __eou__ No worries __eou__ 
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout... __eou__ Don't worry about it - __eou__ 
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me? __eou__ And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN... __eou__ 
Her husband left her __eou__ Oh... __eou__ 
I thought it was you - how are you? __eou__ I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about... __eou__ Yes, come on in... __eou__ 
That's good __eou__ I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say... __eou__ Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time... __eou__ 
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you... __eou__ Yes - of course. __eou__ 
Dr STECKLER? __eou__ Yes...? __eou__ INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word? __eou__ 
Dead? __eou__ Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid. __eou__ So she didn't mention anything more about it? __eou__ No - she isn't in any trouble is she? __eou__ Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand __eou__ I'll be sure to... __eou__ 
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon... __eou__ Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment. __eou__ 
Sugar? __eou__ Yes - one please. __eou__ 
ANGEL... __eou__ Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright __eou__ 
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation... __eou__ You and your pep talks. __eou__ Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for. __eou__ That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer... __eou__ 
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe. __eou__ That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again. __eou__ 
See? Did you see that? __eou__ She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas. __eou__ 
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it. __eou__ Were you always this sick? __eou__ One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked. __eou__ 
Someday, I'll find out. __eou__ You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip. __eou__ 
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents. __eou__ That's crazy talk. __eou__ I defy any and all limits. __eou__ 
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it. __eou__ Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself. __eou__ 
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism. __eou__ Poor Freud, turning in his grave. __eou__ Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation. __eou__ Nobody knows about your mental retardation. __eou__ Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation. __eou__ Nobody knows about your constant masturbation. __eou__ And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding... __eou__ 
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight? __eou__ Astronomical. __eou__ 
Who the hell was your father? __eou__ Well, Dad said... __eou__ 
...A bouncer? Are you serious? __eou__ Maybe he got promoted. __eou__ 
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK! __eou__ Cut it out, before you break something! __eou__ For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight. __eou__ 
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure. __eou__ Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys. __eou__ And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out. __eou__ 
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's. __eou__ Perv. __eou__ 
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro. __eou__ Be cool. Fake it if you have to. __eou__ 
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight? __eou__ This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies. __eou__ Oh. Well. Maybe not yet. __eou__ Not ever. Never. __eou__ 
You kiss your mother with that mouth? __eou__ I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know... __eou__ 
So far away? In Xenia? __eou__ Yeah, whatever. __eou__ 
Check this out.  Hurry! __eou__ I better go, Dad. __eou__ 
Hurry. __eou__ What is it now? __eou__ Check it out! __eou__ 
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty? __eou__ Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS. __eou__ 
I get it now. You and me. We're dead. __eou__ Dead? __eou__ Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven. __eou__ Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate. __eou__ And some really fast cars. __eou__ 
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS. __eou__ It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel. __eou__ I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK. __eou__ 
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb... __eou__ ...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable. __eou__ 
Oh, how inappropriate is that! __eou__ Take a whiff of heaven. __eou__ How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties? __eou__ I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother-- __eou__ Give me those! __eou__ 
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen. __eou__ Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies. __eou__ 
You're late, bro! __eou__ Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic. __eou__ You'll never believe who's in there. __eou__ It better not be my Aunt Trudy. __eou__ 
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck. __eou__ With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip. __eou__ 
I thought I loved her. __eou__ Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner. __eou__ 
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em! __eou__ No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one. __eou__ And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads. __eou__ I love those springy head puppies! __eou__ 
Get them together. __eou__ Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk. __eou__ 
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking? __eou__ We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world. __eou__ Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold. __eou__ 
You got everything you ever wanted. __eou__ Except the girl. The only one that really mattered. __eou__ 
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven." __eou__ This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies. __eou__ 
Never say never. __eou__ Oh, god.  Look. Look. __eou__ 
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right. __eou__ Let me get this straight... __eou__ If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor. __eou__ These are real, live women? __eou__ We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it. __eou__ God, I love being dead. __eou__ 
What gives, Don Corleone? __eou__ We reinvented ourselves. __eou__ New Hushpuppies don't make a new man. __eou__ You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers. __eou__ That explains the emptiness that haunts me. __eou__ Jealousy is so unattractive. __eou__ 
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism. __eou__ He kicked major ass and you know it. __eou__ 
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing? __eou__ From your lips, to God's ears. __eou__ You go first. __eou__ Ladies first.  I insist. __eou__ Well. The prom's coming up. __eou__ Yeah? __eou__ And I was wondering. __eou__ Yeah? __eou__ If you don't have...I mean... __eou__ 
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom? __eou__ SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course. __eou__ 
Ted, have you lost your mind? __eou__ You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone. __eou__ I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS. __eou__ But that smile. __eou__ Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off. __eou__ So you'll think about it? __eou__ 
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing! __eou__ So that's a maybe? __eou__ The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams. __eou__ 
Great jacket, Teddy Bear. __eou__ Yeah? You like? __eou__ Makes your shoulders look so big and broad. __eou__ 
Hi, Teddy Bear. __eou__ Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?" __eou__ I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible. __eou__ 
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear. __eou__ I do? I mean, yeah, I do. __eou__ I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now. __eou__ Do it? __eou__ You know...take the pictures? __eou__ 
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail. __eou__ Which you pulled, hard! __eou__ That was code for "I like you." __eou__ 
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess. __eou__ I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence. __eou__ Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself. __eou__ 
Well? __eou__ You have changed since second grade. __eou__ I mean, what do you think? __eou__ You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain. __eou__ Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny. __eou__ 
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you. __eou__ Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse. __eou__ Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry? __eou__ 
God, you are so hot. __eou__ Then you better get in the water, before you get burned. __eou__ 
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning. __eou__ We own a small family grocery store. __eou__ 
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear? __eou__ Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but... __eou__ 
Sweetheart, what is it? __eou__ I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors. __eou__ Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance. __eou__ 
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business. __eou__ We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest. __eou__ We love our lives just the way they are. __eou__ 
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire. __eou__ But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son. __eou__ Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family? __eou__ 
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that. __eou__ We miss you. We miss our son. __eou__ We miss our family. __eou__ 
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes. __eou__ We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after. __eou__ 
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment. __eou__ It's my private business! Mine! __eou__ 
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago. __eou__ Dad, please. __eou__ Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches. __eou__ Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you? __eou__ You're way ahead of me again? __eou__ It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow. __eou__ The lesson being? __eou__ Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end. __eou__ I'm getting so good at this. __eou__ 
You guys are my parents. __eou__ Of course we are. __eou__ They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care... __eou__ 
Son. __eou__ Well, why should I? __eou__ They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby. __eou__ I guess. __eou__ They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy. __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be? __eou__ I guess we could go to Disneyland or something. __eou__ Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood. __eou__ Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks? __eou__ Whatever helps you cope. __eou__ I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face. __eou__ There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach... __eou__ ...not the pit. __eou__ 
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words. __eou__ Just say it, Dad. __eou__ I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all? __eou__ Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore. __eou__ Well, good. Every little bit helps. __eou__ 
Finally, some gratitude. __eou__ We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true. __eou__ 
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true. __eou__ Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives. __eou__ 
Sorry I-- __eou__ It's okay. You need me? __eou__ Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores. __eou__ 
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me? __eou__ You ordered a Winnebago? __eou__ 
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine. __eou__ Watch your tone, mister. __eou__ Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore. __eou__ 
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy. __eou__ I will not have my boys arguing. __eou__ 
I-I don't have the keys. __eou__ They're in the ignition, silly. __eou__ 
You do know how to drive? __eou__ I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick. __eou__ Want a lesson? __eou__ 
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear. __eou__ Got it. __eou__ 
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again. __eou__ I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car. __eou__ It's your car. These are all your cars. __eou__ Some of them have to be automatics. __eou__ Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy." __eou__ 
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that. __eou__ I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April. __eou__ The one with the horses. __eou__ That's me. __eou__ I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs. __eou__ 
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping? __eou__ Shopping, really? I should tell my friend. __eou__ Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room. __eou__ Hi ho, Silver. __eou__ 
Who exactly ARE you? __eou__ What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson. __eou__ And who IS Ted Nelson? __eou__ 
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood. __eou__ I always knew there was more. I felt it. __eou__ Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS. __eou__ 
Teddy? I was thinking. __eou__ Hmmm? __eou__ After graduation...maybe we could go away together? __eou__ Whatever you want. __eou__ 
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here. __eou__ Of course we were. __eou__ 
Ted! Do something! __eou__ What do you want me to do? __eou__ This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom! __eou__ Hang in there, I'll think of something. __eou__ 
Well? __eou__ I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted. __eou__ 
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you! __eou__ But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust. __eou__ But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now. __eou__ If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right? __eou__ 
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad. __eou__ We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this. __eou__ 
Can you believe that was me? __eou__ Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history. __eou__ So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything. __eou__ Everything. __eou__ 
You're on the next plane home. __eou__ I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary. __eou__ 
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem? __eou__ We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can. __eou__ 
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation. __eou__ Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal. __eou__ 
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar. __eou__ You mean they knew who I was? __eou__ They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them. __eou__ 
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up. __eou__ Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours. __eou__ My legacy. __eou__ Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it. __eou__ They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much. __eou__ I understand. __eou__ And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me. __eou__ But how can you respect yourself if you don't? __eou__ 
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia? __eou__ Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive. __eou__ Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee? __eou__ 
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols. __eou__ What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?" __eou__ 
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty." __eou__ I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers? __eou__ Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation. __eou__ 
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed. __eou__ Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store! __eou__ 
James, what are you doing here? __eou__ You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious. __eou__ Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know? __eou__ She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother. __eou__ It's really late...do your parents know where you are? __eou__ 
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house. __eou__ Most places are, Jimmy. __eou__ They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile. __eou__ So, what brings you here at his hour? __eou__ My new bike. __eou__ Very funny. __eou__ I came to ask permission to take custody of your room. __eou__ My room? __eou__ Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer. __eou__ It's not up to me. __eou__ Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home. __eou__ You can have it, then. I'm not going back there. __eou__ 
If you could just sign right there. __eou__ You want it in writing? __eou__ Just a formality. __eou__ 
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff. __eou__ Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time. __eou__ Are they okay? __eou__ Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better. __eou__ I miss them, too. __eou__ You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine. __eou__ You're a peach. __eou__ Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer. __eou__ 
He was my Grandfather, too. __eou__ I meant biologically. __eou__ That's a crappy thing to say. __eou__ Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy. __eou__ 
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids. __eou__ I didn't forget. __eou__ You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it? __eou__ 
Great. __eou__ From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big. __eou__ 
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale. __eou__ That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference. __eou__ Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof! __eou__ The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up. __eou__ 
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss? __eou__ Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD. __eou__ 
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there. __eou__ Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future. __eou__ I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job. __eou__ Me-ow. __eou__ Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with. __eou__ I have absolutely no intention-- __eou__ --Do it. I triple-dog-dare you. __eou__ 
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds. __eou__ But you triple-dog-dared me. __eou__ It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way. __eou__ 
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year. __eou__ It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy. __eou__ 
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching? __eou__ Your article sucked. __eou__ In what sense? __eou__ In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs. __eou__ Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there. __eou__ Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent. __eou__ Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago. __eou__ I'm trying to help. __eou__ I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account. __eou__ That's not ENTIRELY true. __eou__ 
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up. __eou__ Then I'll write about YOU. __eou__ Me? __eou__ "Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest. __eou__ Really? You wanna write about me? __eou__ 
I have to admit, I always felt... different. __eou__ Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps? __eou__ I don't get the distinction. __eou__ Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew? __eou__ I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating. __eou__ I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist. __eou__ I guess. __eou__ Interesting. __eou__ 
She said peanuts, you cretin. __eou__ You never know around here. __eou__ 
Don't write that part. __eou__ Is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release? __eou__ Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me. __eou__ Life must be peachy on Planet Ted. __eou__ Funny you should say "peachy." __eou__ I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer. __eou__ My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did. __eou__ Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort. __eou__ 
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier. __eou__ I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted. __eou__ See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic. __eou__ And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. __eou__ A little respect would be nice, that's all. __eou__ 
Well? What do you think of her? __eou__ You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax. __eou__ You're implying she's, what, a gold digger? __eou__ 
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive. __eou__ Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit. __eou__ Why can't you be nice to me? __eou__ You've got enough people kissing your ass. __eou__ 
Wow...you clean up nice. __eou__ Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in. __eou__ 
Where are we going? __eou__ To the best hiding place in the world. __eou__ 
I can't believe your dad built this for you. __eou__ He didn't. He had it built. __eou__ Whatever. __eou__ Not "whatever."  It's two different things. __eou__ He cared enough to want you to have it. __eou__ He phoned it in. __eou__ I see. __eou__ I doubt it. __eou__ Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl. __eou__ The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted. __eou__ You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball? __eou__ Your dad taught you everything. __eou__ I mean my father. __eou__ A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad. __eou__ It's all so complicated. __eou__ It's incredibly simple. __eou__ I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction. __eou__ Eventually you'll let go. __eou__ And then what? __eou__ Then you'll see who's really holding on to you. __eou__ You're amazing. __eou__ I know. __eou__ Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you. __eou__ But you never do. __eou__ If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything. __eou__ 
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you. __eou__ In a word: MERK. EXPOSED. __eou__ That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout. __eou__ There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper. __eou__ You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him. __eou__ He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches! __eou__ 
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft. __eou__ Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week... __eou__ 
That's probably my office. __eou__ Well? Where the hell are you? __eou__ He's on the move? __eou__ I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati. __eou__ Let's do it. __eou__ 
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame. __eou__ You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood? __eou__ At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue. __eou__ Amen to that. __eou__ 
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart. __eou__ I'm trembling with excitement. __eou__ That has more to do with your proximity to me. __eou__ My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh. __eou__ I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that. __eou__ I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy. __eou__ Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing. __eou__ Wearing them?  Or humping them? __eou__ My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs. __eou__ That's refreshingly deviant. __eou__ What about you? __eou__ I'm very aural. __eou__ Tell me more. __eou__ Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch. __eou__ I see. __eou__ I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me. __eou__ A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo." __eou__ You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust. __eou__ Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming. __eou__ You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever. __eou__ 
Do you trust me, Julie? __eou__ Not a chance. __eou__ Come on. __eou__ Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire. __eou__ 
I want you to trust me. __eou__ Maybe someday. __eou__ Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do. __eou__ That's hard to believe. __eou__ But absolutely true. __eou__ 
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia." __eou__ I know, their small town mentality can be maddening. __eou__ I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly. __eou__ Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor. __eou__ 
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts. __eou__ You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all. __eou__ Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades? __eou__ You're quick. I like that. __eou__ You think you're working with chimps here? __eou__ The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word. __eou__ Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted. __eou__ 
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again. __eou__ I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams. __eou__ I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know. __eou__ 
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain." __eou__ Very ambitious. I like that. __eou__ The thing is, I'll need a first mate. __eou__ I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board. __eou__ 
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening? __eou__ I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio. __eou__ 
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief. __eou__ Yellow pages? __eou__ Let your fingers do the walking. __eou__ 
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance? __eou__ You better. __eou__ 
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day? __eou__ No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you. __eou__ I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town! __eou__ 
That's part of growing up, honey. __eou__ What? Having spring break ruined by will readings? __eou__ 
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure. __eou__ Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this? __eou__ 
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know. __eou__ Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you? __eou__ Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin. __eou__ Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill. __eou__ It's okay, Mom.  Trust me. __eou__ 
Well? Surprised? __eou__ What is all this? When are you coming home? __eou__ Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry. __eou__ Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive. __eou__ Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from. __eou__ 
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes? __eou__ Only the best for my mother. __eou__ You promise you'll finish school? __eou__ I'll make you very proud. __eou__ 
You don't have to work another day in your lives. __eou__ But how would we pay our bills? __eou__ 
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue. __eou__ Oh. Goodness. __eou__ You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do! __eou__ Like what? __eou__ Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance. __eou__ 
But who would run the store? __eou__ Forget the store. Think big. __eou__ 
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me? __eou__ Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much. __eou__ 
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit. __eou__ Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you. __eou__ 
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich. __eou__ Thanks, Principal Merkin. __eou__ I'll be blunt. I know you can take it. __eou__ Yes, sir. I'll brace myself. __eou__ Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you. __eou__ You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire? __eou__ That's a good start, yes. A very good start. __eou__ Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream. __eou__ I never figured you for a pimp. __eou__ Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?" __eou__ What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing. __eou__ I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then? __eou__ 
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment? __eou__ We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community! __eou__ If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress. __eou__ 
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire. __eou__ Rules are rules. __eou__ Come on, it's our only senior prom. __eou__ Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power. __eou__ 
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson. __eou__ A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin? __eou__ I'm warning you. __eou__ A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything. __eou__ 
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade. __eou__ Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law. __eou__ What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night? __eou__ Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking. __eou__ You called the cops on us? __eou__ Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind. __eou__ 
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please? __eou__ Uh, sure. Uncle Billy. __eou__ I have only one concern... __eou__ 
You do like girls, don't you? __eou__ Of course I like girls. __eou__ A lot? I mean, a whole lot? __eou__ As much as possible. __eou__ You're sure? __eou__ 
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom. __eou__ Seldom? No kidding? __eou__ 
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon? __eou__ Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were. __eou__ 
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman. __eou__ I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own. __eou__ 
We don't allow TIPN, Ted. __eou__ Tipping? __eou__ 
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right? __eou__ Yeah.  Everything's cool. __eou__ 
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you. __eou__ Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression. __eou__ They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that. __eou__ 
Truth is, I'm a little nervous. __eou__ YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous? __eou__ All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure. __eou__ Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure! __eou__ I do? __eou__ You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms. __eou__ 
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus. __eou__ Me? The King of Coitus? __eou__ The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality. __eou__ Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually... __eou__ Why, look who's here. __eou__ 
I told you you could do it. __eou__ I was like a different person tonight. __eou__ You were the new and improved you. __eou__ I would have been laughed right out of Xenia. __eou__ No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank. __eou__ It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days. __eou__ You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine. __eou__ Really? You'd do that for me? __eou__ I've been very lazy for a long, long time. __eou__ You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy. __eou__ I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second. __eou__ My parents always say hard work builds character. __eou__ It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts. __eou__ What kind of ideas? __eou__ Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty." __eou__ You think we should be more open minded? __eou__ The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine. __eou__ In other words, our scope is too narrow. __eou__ At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down. __eou__ That's perfect. __eou__ 
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications. __eou__ I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why. __eou__ 
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential. __eou__ Really? So I'm doing OK? __eou__ 
My father must've been amazing. __eou__ He was in a league of his own. __eou__ 
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red. __eou__ I can't wait to see the pictures. __eou__ It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything. __eou__ 
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you? __eou__ Seriously? I'm doing all right? __eou__ You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you. __eou__ 
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost. __eou__ I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up. __eou__ Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents. __eou__ 
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking. __eou__ You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print. __eou__ Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything. __eou__ You're a great kid. Don't you forget it. __eou__ 
Yes? __eou__ We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk. __eou__ 
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is-- __eou__ --PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES! __eou__ 
What are you doing? __eou__ My job. Back off, Benedict. __eou__ 
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood. __eou__ All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby. __eou__ That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line. __eou__ Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes. __eou__ 
In a hurry, are we? __eou__ I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling? __eou__ Bad news. __eou__ People pay good money for that? __eou__ I'm just a messenger. __eou__ 
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day. __eou__ It's about your parents. __eou__ 
My parents? What do you mean? __eou__ I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty. __eou__ You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot. __eou__ Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents. __eou__ 
How quaint. __eou__ It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading. __eou__ 
Are you familiar with "Heaven?" __eou__ I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand. __eou__ Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions? __eou__ 
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life? __eou__ I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie. __eou__ 
Talk to me Artie. __eou__ Kelly Van Ryan... __eou__ ... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know... __eou__ Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension... __eou__ This is insane. __eou__ 
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay... __eou__ That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it. __eou__ The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one. __eou__ 
How you doing, Artie? __eou__ I... You know... I... __eou__ 
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night... __eou__ Eat a power bar. __eou__ 
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid? __eou__ Kelly. __eou__ She's going to wash your Jeep? __eou__ Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause. __eou__ 
You look pretty. __eou__ Thanks. __eou__ 
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner. __eou__ And where might that be? __eou__ I was thinking, Antigua, maybe. __eou__ I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you. __eou__ I'd like that. __eou__ 
How soon can we get something? __eou__ We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks. __eou__ 
Merritt, Forensics. __eou__ The teeth doin' any talkin'? __eou__ Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time... __eou__ What about the blood? __eou__ Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too... __eou__ Second you get something on those teeth, I want it __eou__ 
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth. __eou__ What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway? __eou__ Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway. __eou__ 
You come all the way out here to watch Walter? __eou__ I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions. __eou__ About Suzie? __eou__ Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette. __eou__ He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades. __eou__ 
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear. __eou__ She still work there? __eou__ No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette. __eou__ Was there ever any kind of investigation... __eou__ 
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her. __eou__ And the child... __eou__ She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child... __eou__ Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother... __eou__ Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him. __eou__ 
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters. __eou__ And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece. __eou__ 
You okay? __eou__ I'm fine.  Nice TV. __eou__ 
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute? __eou__ I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it. __eou__ I know you do. __eou__ 
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers... __eou__ Take your time. __eou__ They were in me.  Both places... you know. __eou__ I understand. __eou__ He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor. __eou__ Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you? __eou__ Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me... __eou__ That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you? __eou__ No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know... __eou__ He was large? __eou__ 
Did you try to fight him? __eou__ I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.' __eou__ Then what? __eou__ He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped. __eou__ You mean he withdrew... __eou__ Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly. __eou__ Try, Kelly. __eou__ I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come." __eou__ 
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour. __eou__ I'd like that. __eou__ 
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car? __eou__ Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab. __eou__ 
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons? __eou__ No. __eou__ Weren't you a little worried about her...? __eou__ There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office. __eou__ 
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows? __eou__ Suzie Toller is missing. __eou__ 
How long? __eou__ She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket. __eou__ Maybe she used another name. __eou__ Ray thinks she was murdered. __eou__ 
I don't know what to say... __eou__ You could tell me where you were last night. __eou__ 
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify. __eou__ Suzie? __eou__ 
I've got that two o'clock in town. __eou__ Back to the land of grownups. __eou__ 
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior? __eou__ All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here. __eou__ 
It's our job, Gloria. __eou__ Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary. __eou__ 
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow. __eou__ Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt? __eou__ 
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his. __eou__ You're telling me you believe the guy? __eou__ All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid. __eou__ 
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die. __eou__ Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now. __eou__ 
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay? __eou__ The skinny brunette. __eou__ This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine. __eou__ You mean Camp Sixty-Nine. __eou__ 
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place. __eou__ It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do? __eou__ 
You saw the news today? __eou__ Lombardo's settlement? __eou__ 
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place. __eou__ Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial. __eou__ I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless... __eou__ Unless what? __eou__ Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday. __eou__ 
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start. __eou__ Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing... __eou__ The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his. __eou__ 
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father... __eou__ Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck. __eou__ 
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it? __eou__ I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it. __eou__ Eliminate the competition. __eou__ You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp. __eou__ 
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway? __eou__ I net a guy in a bar. __eou__ 
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life. __eou__ What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did... __eou__ 
Guess I kind of lost it there. __eou__ You could say that. __eou__ Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it? __eou__ 
We all have... __eou__ I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again. __eou__ 
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins... __eou__ Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere... __eou__ 
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me? __eou__ You have someplace to be? __eou__ 
If you want company... __eou__ Just check out the car. __eou__ 
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth. __eou__ Those are Suzie Toller's teeth. __eou__ Where's the body? __eou__ The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake. __eou__ 
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal. __eou__ You don't think Sam could've put it there? __eou__ 
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance. __eou__ We don't know that, Ray... __eou__ 
Will you do me one favor? __eou__ Ray, you heard him... __eou__ What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming? __eou__ 
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you... __eou__ And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up? __eou__ If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise. __eou__ 
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home. __eou__ Where's Lombardo? __eou__ He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit. __eou__ The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's. __eou__ It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track... __eou__ 
That bothers you? __eou__ Yeah, maybe, a little. __eou__ Why is that? __eou__ 
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news. __eou__ We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride? __eou__ 
About a year ago. __eou__ He dropped Jimmy off first? __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there? __eou__ No. __eou__ So you were alone. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Did he come in with you? __eou__ I guess. __eou__ 
At that point were you able to fight him off? __eou__ No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go. __eou__ 
He did say something. __eou__ What was that? __eou__ He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come." __eou__ 
Why? __eou__ I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't... __eou__ 
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away... __eou__ Where's this coming from? __eou__ I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers. __eou__ 
I want a full-scale investigation. __eou__ You know what that will mean for Lombardo. __eou__ I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case. __eou__ 
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for... __eou__ The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay. __eou__ 
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit. __eou__ What about witnesses? __eou__ We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops. __eou__ And what do they say? __eou__ 
Are you crazy, Ray? __eou__ You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls... __eou__ Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick... __eou__ I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money. __eou__ 
Oh, Ray... no... __eou__ You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead... __eou__ 
Kelly's next, Gloria. __eou__ Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me. __eou__ 
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do? __eou__ Just tell us what happened. __eou__ I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights. __eou__ 
She bit you? __eou__ Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom. __eou__ 
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together. __eou__ You didn't cuff her? __eou__ She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest. __eou__ 
The teeth, were they... __eou__ Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass. __eou__ 
You guess?  Did he or didn't he? __eou__ Yeah... okay... he did __eou__ And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little... __eou__ I wanna go home now. __eou__ 
What did you do then? __eou__ Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway... __eou__ Suzie!  Did this man rape you? __eou__ Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home? __eou__ 
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt. __eou__ I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why? __eou__ Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp. __eou__ 
Ms. Toller? __eou__ I said he did. __eou__ Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you? __eou__ 
This wasn't my idea. __eou__ I'm sorry? __eou__ 
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed. __eou__ Your Honor... Please... __eou__ 
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it? __eou__ No! __eou__ 
Thank you, Jimmy. __eou__ Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate. __eou__ 
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees... __eou__ Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be. __eou__ 
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride? __eou__ What? __eou__ A ride.  You want one? __eou__ Yeah.  But I got my bike. __eou__ 
It's those rocks, up there. __eou__ You and Suzie used to come out here together? __eou__ Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie? __eou__ Lombardo ever come out here? __eou__ 
I say something funny? __eou__ No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would... __eou__ Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys... __eou__ Yeah, but... __eou__ 
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him. __eou__ Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me... __eou__ Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit. __eou__ Man, I wanna smoke a joint. __eou__ 
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you? __eou__ I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust. __eou__ You can trust me. __eou__ 
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you? __eou__ Oh, for Christ's sake. __eou__ You are. __eou__ Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp... __eou__ 
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain? __eou__ What brain? __eou__ 
What are you looking at? __eou__ Nothing. __eou__ 
I thought we were goin' to a movie. __eou__ I think we just need to get wasted. __eou__ 
I wanna live at the beach someday. __eou__ Shit. __eou__ 
Is there some reason why you're here? __eou__ Curiosity, I guess. __eou__ About what?  How to improve your breast stroke? __eou__ 
Excuse me? __eou__ You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together? __eou__ 
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out. __eou__ You're out of your mind. __eou__ I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money? __eou__ 
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly. __eou__ Police -- God -- get a life. __eou__ 
Get off my property. __eou__ I'm not on your property! __eou__ 
Is that Sam Lombardo? __eou__ Hi, Mon. __eou__ Sam!  Hi! __eou__ 
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that? __eou__ Whichever one I want. __eou__ 
Okay, what's the matter? __eou__ You notice my new jumper? __eou__ 
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash. __eou__ I would hardly say you look like trash. __eou__ No thanks to you. __eou__ 
Kelly.  What is it? __eou__ I miss Dad. __eou__ Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes... __eou__ No you don't. __eou__ He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married. __eou__ 
What? __eou__ I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo. __eou__ 
He... Sam Lombardo? __eou__ Yes.  God, Mom... __eou__ 
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me... __eou__ I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight. __eou__ Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip. __eou__ Where, the mall? __eou__ A friend of mine bought a boat. __eou__ 
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off. __eou__ Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one? __eou__ 
Don't forget the car wash. __eou__ I won't. __eou__ 
Look, he forgot.  I knew it. __eou__ No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving. __eou__ 
Where's the hose?  We can set up. __eou__ In back of the garage. __eou__ 
So, where you off to now? __eou__ Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it. __eou__ Jeez, that thing... Can't you... __eou__ Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo. __eou__ 
All right.  I'll have to look for it. __eou__ Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket. __eou__ 
Kelly... __eou__ Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you... __eou__ Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning. __eou__ 
Jesus Christ, what are you doing? __eou__ So you got my mom's money. __eou__ 
How much? __eou__ About six and a half million dollars. __eou__ 
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here. __eou__ Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom. __eou__ 
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood... __eou__ Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party. __eou__ 
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves... __eou__ Do it to ourselves? __eou__ We have to stick with the plan. __eou__ Stick? __eou__ 
Kelly.  Is Suzie there? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down? __eou__ Why can't you come... __eou__ No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes... __eou__ You know what it takes. __eou__ Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay? __eou__ 
I'm here. __eou__ Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds. __eou__ 
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it... __eou__ There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb... __eou__ 
Hello? __eou__ Hello. __eou__ God, I've been calling you. __eou__ 
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me. __eou__ Duquette.  Forget him... __eou__ I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something... __eou__ Yeah, he got her busted for possession... __eou__ I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit... __eou__ And you believe her? __eou__ I don't know.  I want to see you... __eou__ Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich. __eou__ But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber... __eou__ 
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you. __eou__ Okay.  I love you too. __eou__ 
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades. __eou__ That's not your line. __eou__ Say you love me. __eou__ I love you.  Now give me the line. __eou__ No little girl can ever make me come. __eou__ 
I'm running away. __eou__ You think that's wise? __eou__ Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys. __eou__ 
But check this... __eou__ Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here. __eou__ 
Good thinking. __eou__ You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan... __eou__ Forget it. __eou__ Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying. __eou__ I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank? __eou__ 
Can't you take that stupid thing off? __eou__ Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes. __eou__ 
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan. __eou__ What's that supposed to mean? __eou__ For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless. __eou__ 
Nellie Gail Ranch... __eou__ Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right. __eou__ There's nothing for them to get. __eou__ Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution... __eou__ I just want my life back... __eou__ Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement. __eou__ 
Come on, let loose! __eou__ I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare. __eou__ You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan. __eou__ Just like that? __eou__ Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro. __eou__ 
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo. __eou__ That's right. __eou__ 
Who is it? __eou__ Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now. __eou__ 
Where is she? __eou__ Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about? __eou__ I'm placing your daughter under arrest. __eou__ You can't... __eou__ Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way. __eou__ 
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez. __eou__ I did.  At Blue Balls. __eou__ 
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are. __eou__ So Suzie, you called us, remember? __eou__ 
No. __eou__ Will they? __eou__ It doesn't look like it. __eou__ Then he'll be back at Blue Balls? __eou__ 
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser. __eou__ You got something against cigarettes? __eou__ 
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you... __eou__ That's cop bullshit. __eou__ Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me. __eou__ About what? __eou__ Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go. __eou__ Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle? __eou__ You, Kelly, Sam. __eou__ I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now... __eou__ 
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you? __eou__ I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends... __eou__ Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit... __eou__ 
Get away from me. __eou__ Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet? __eou__ Shut up. __eou__ 
Davy. __eou__ That's right.  That was his name. __eou__ 
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him... __eou__ Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water. __eou__ 
Sam, for godsake. __eou__ Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's? __eou__ 
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house. __eou__ Story's the same, Detective... __eou__ 
I had to go look for this coupon. __eou__ The one you bought at school. __eou__ Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly. __eou__ In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ And she wanted to talk. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about. __eou__ I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place. __eou__ And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her. __eou__ Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office. __eou__ 
But she ran away. __eou__ That's right. __eou__ 
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules? __eou__ It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying... __eou__ With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra... __eou__ 
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here. __eou__ Sit down, Lombardo. __eou__ 
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway? __eou__ The bitch shot me, is what happened. __eou__ 
Hey, what did you want me to do, die? __eou__ Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake. __eou__ 
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better. __eou__ Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises. __eou__ 
You mean this thing? __eou__ Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays. __eou__ I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat? __eou__ Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet. __eou__ Yeah, or get me drowned. __eou__ 
Jesus, man... You okay? __eou__ That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean... __eou__ Come off it, man... It was an accident. __eou__ 
How much is about six and a half million divided by three? __eou__ Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change. __eou__ 
Sam... __eou__ Put Kelly on too. __eou__ 
But I.. __eou__ Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember? __eou__ 
Yeah, right. __eou__ Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us. __eou__ 
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up. __eou__ Are you mad at me? __eou__ No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight. __eou__ 
That was about as grim as it gets. __eou__ The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that. __eou__ But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on... __eou__ But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends. __eou__ 
What? __eou__ That was the same thing Ray said. __eou__ 
What's wrong? __eou__ Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive. __eou__ 
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met. __eou__ Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot. __eou__ Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend. __eou__ 
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back? __eou__ We? __eou__ Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already. __eou__ 
How... __eou__ Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo? __eou__ I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them. __eou__ 
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi? __eou__ Hi, Sandy. __eou__ Why don't you come in, have a drink? __eou__ Can't.  Got a passenger. __eou__ 
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run. __eou__ I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out... __eou__ Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans. __eou__ What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat... __eou__ Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time. __eou__ 
Sandy... What's up? __eou__ Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her? __eou__ No. __eou__ Shit. Here we go again. __eou__ Didn't you see her this morning? __eou__ To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday. __eou__ 
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what? __eou__ So maybe I'm a one-woman man. __eou__ 
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts. __eou__ Goodbye, Sandra. __eou__ 
J. S. Bach. __eou__ Jim West. __eou__ Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer. __eou__ I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something? __eou__ Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal. __eou__ Funny.  So am I. __eou__ Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark. __eou__ Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime. __eou__ Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk... __eou__ 
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened? __eou__ Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors. __eou__ 
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment. __eou__ If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco. __eou__ 
But don't pull that again. __eou__ Wouldn't dream of it. __eou__ 
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics... __eou__ Put them all together and what do we have? __eou__ A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists. __eou__ Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them? __eou__ "Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy. __eou__ 
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine... __eou__ Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy. __eou__ "Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science. __eou__ 
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas. __eou__ You need that real often? __eou__ Always hoping.  Or this... __eou__ No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this. __eou__ Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace! __eou__ All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that. __eou__ Try what? __eou__ 
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful. __eou__ Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots... __eou__ 
That should put us ahead of the criminals. __eou__ I'll work on it. __eou__ 
Aha! __eou__ Aha? __eou__ Yes, aha.  A brass screw. __eou__ Is this leading somewhere? __eou__ Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain. __eou__ Starting with a screw? __eou__ Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but... __eou__ What about the explosive? __eou__ 
Limestone quarry? __eou__ Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party. __eou__ Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women. __eou__ 
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare. __eou__ Prepare what? __eou__ My disguise.  And here... __eou__ 
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry. __eou__ Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong. __eou__ Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet. __eou__ 
That's a lot of butler. __eou__ Quite.  Come, let's mingle. __eou__ Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey. __eou__ 
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man. __eou__ Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe. __eou__ All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him... __eou__ Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist? __eou__ 
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I. __eou__ Almost? __eou__ Yes.  Now, observe.... __eou__ 
You feeling all right? __eou__ Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it. __eou__ 
Now, what was that? __eou__ You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello." __eou__ Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it. __eou__ 
What was all that back there? __eou__ All what? __eou__ All that jumping and kicking. __eou__ That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested. __eou__ 
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again. __eou__ And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it. __eou__ 
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention. __eou__ I'm going to hit you. __eou__ 
Never seen a gun fire so fast! __eou__ It's a repeating steam cannon! __eou__ 
At least I tried something. __eou__ Hey, I tried the board. __eou__ 
Damn it, this is ridiculous. __eou__ At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting. __eou__ That's right... That's good. __eou__ 
Jim, are you all right? __eou__ No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want. __eou__ Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works. __eou__ 
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are? __eou__ What way is that? __eou__ So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot. __eou__ "Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch." __eou__ Well... that, too. __eou__ Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly. __eou__ 
So... what happened? __eou__ Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back. __eou__ Uh... how long ago was this? __eou__ I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later. __eou__ 
You might have mentioned you had that. __eou__ I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun. __eou__ 
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded. __eou__ I find most criminals slip up somewhere... __eou__ 
They're so precious when they're asleep. __eou__ You really enjoy yourself, don't you? __eou__ 
Can you fill me in here? __eou__ Sure.  We have no idea what's going on. __eou__ Thank you. __eou__ Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton. __eou__ You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless. __eou__ 
Know what this is? __eou__ Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing. __eou__ A cylinder recorder.  My own design. __eou__ 
This is good. __eou__ Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something! __eou__ 
Oh, damn!  That's it. __eou__ It's better than nothing. __eou__ It is? __eou__ He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard. __eou__ 
No record of him. __eou__ You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen. __eou__ 
What's this? __eou__ Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train. __eou__ Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours. __eou__ 
Willard... __eou__ It's not a guy... __eou__ It's a town! __eou__ 
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot." __eou__ That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico? __eou__ 
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster. __eou__ Relax.  We're almost there. __eou__ We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left! __eou__ 
What is that? __eou__ This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds. __eou__ And people are actually fooled by that? __eou__ My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear. __eou__ 
Not again. __eou__ I adjusted it. __eou__ 
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand? __eou__ You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it? __eou__ 
When we find him, he is mine. __eou__ Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty. __eou__ 
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim? __eou__ Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards... __eou__ 
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first. __eou__ Oh, thank you. __eou__ My pleasure. __eou__ 
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque. __eou__ What?  President Grant is...! __eou__ I know!  I know! __eou__ I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers! __eou__ We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter. __eou__ I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men? __eou__ There's only seventy-eight. __eou__ Oh, well, then let's kick some ass! __eou__ 
It was in your book. __eou__ Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance. __eou__ 
Are those just button buttons or...? __eou__ Of course not. __eou__ 
My hat is off to you, sir. __eou__ Thank you. __eou__ 
God in heaven, what is that?! __eou__ That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts! __eou__ 
My God!  He's so excessive! __eou__ Where have you been? __eou__ 
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing! __eou__ Oh, I see, an easy plan! __eou__ 
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?! __eou__ He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?! __eou__ All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam. __eou__ In the next two minutes? __eou__ 
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling. __eou__ What is this?  A whole new train? __eou__ Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders? __eou__ 
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know. __eou__ I'm sure we will. __eou__ 
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim... __eou__ Yes, me! __eou__ You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel. __eou__ 
You didn't tell us you had this on! __eou__ My Lord, he was telling the truth! __eou__ 
He calls it the Tarantula. __eou__ But it only has six legs. __eou__ 
He's not giving up? __eou__ Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid... __eou__ 
Time for you to get off, Ma'am. __eou__ Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard! __eou__ 
A new friend? __eou__ We'll see. __eou__ 
Anyone? __eou__ Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms. __eou__ Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please... __eou__ 
I could get used to this, looking down on people. __eou__ They don't even realize they should be frightened. __eou__ Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs. __eou__ 
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. __eou__ I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening. __eou__ You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle. __eou__ I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before. __eou__ 
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm. __eou__ Really? __eou__ Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas. __eou__ My... the wild west. __eou__ 
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests. __eou__ Your guests, ma'am? __eou__ Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know. __eou__ 
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list. __eou__ Well, I owe you one, don't I? __eou__ You most certainly do. __eou__ 
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game. __eou__ I don't like to lose, either. __eou__ 
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler? __eou__ You tell me. __eou__ I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger. __eou__ Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type. __eou__ Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it? __eou__ I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too. __eou__ 
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected. __eou__ Would that include me? __eou__ Oh, I would hope not. __eou__ 
You've... done... this... before. __eou__ I've had some practice. __eou__ 
She's perfectly safe. __eou__ Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting? __eou__ 
My.  It's gotten longer. __eou__ You bring the best out in a man. __eou__ I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case. __eou__ 
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me. __eou__ Fine, I'll stop. __eou__ 
Look, I'm Captain James West... __eou__ Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here. __eou__ 
Your private train, sir. __eou__ Private train? __eou__ That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well. __eou__ 
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard. __eou__ My friend? __eou__ 
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir? __eou__ I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game? __eou__ 
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not? __eou__ Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case... __eou__ 
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence. __eou__ Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French... __eou__ French? __eou__ Yes sir. __eou__ French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture! __eou__ 
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean... __eou__ A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake? __eou__ 
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that. __eou__ That'll be all, boys. __eou__ 
Good work.  Really. __eou__ This is Colonel Richards. __eou__ Nice to finally meet you, sir. __eou__ 
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power. __eou__ Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced. __eou__ 
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way! __eou__ Nicely said, sir. __eou__ Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking. __eou__ 
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues... __eou__ And? __eou__ And now the job's yours. __eou__ 
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here? __eou__ On my way to Denver... __eou__ 
Where'd he say he was going to do this? __eou__ He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer. __eou__ 
I admire a man with a sense of humor. __eou__ When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you? __eou__ 
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant. __eou__ Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have. __eou__ 
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade. __eou__ No, sir... just a businessman. __eou__ Really?  Must be a dangerous business. __eou__ I deal with some tough customers. __eou__ 
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels. __eou__ How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers? __eou__ 
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk. __eou__ Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that? __eou__ 
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head! __eou__ Dr. Loveless? __eou__ 
You're not that big. __eou__ Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant. __eou__ 
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno. __eou__ He had a pressing engagement. __eou__ Philistine. __eou__ 
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here. __eou__ Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain! __eou__ Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader? __eou__ 
The U.S. is my jurisdiction. __eou__ Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?! __eou__ 
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression. __eou__ That would be... the Mexican War? __eou__ Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country! __eou__ 
I've even printed my own currency. __eou__ "Emperor Miguelito...?" __eou__ The first. __eou__ Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you? __eou__ Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire! __eou__ So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer? __eou__ 
Easy now. __eou__ Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!? __eou__ 
Dr. Pemberton? __eou__ Yes! __eou__ 
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe. __eou__ Who were they?  What do they want with me? __eou__ We'll explain on the way. __eou__ 
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do. __eou__ Who was this partner of his? __eou__ A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye. __eou__ A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch. __eou__ 
Are you all right? __eou__ For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now. __eou__ 
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he? __eou__ He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out. __eou__ 
This is something. __eou__ It's a smelting retort. __eou__ 
Now it's a bomb. __eou__ It is? __eou__ 
I beg your pardon? __eou__ You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this. __eou__ 
Well? __eou__ They're coming. __eou__ When are they coming? __eou__ They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour? __eou__ In an hour they're gone! __eou__ 
Hey...! __eou__ You're not going to use it, are you? __eou__ Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men... __eou__ Right. __eou__ 
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it. __eou__ He thought you were a woman, Airk! __eou__ 
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time? __eou__ Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place! __eou__ 
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage. __eou__ Least I'm not down there herding sheep! __eou__ 
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here. __eou__ Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you! __eou__ Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you. __eou__ 
You left me to die, friend. __eou__ You managed alright. __eou__ Is this what's left of your army? __eou__ 
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time? __eou__ They're not after me.  They want the baby. __eou__ 
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone? __eou__ Then come with us. __eou__ 
You're chasing a dream. __eou__ Just get me some horses. __eou__ 
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk? __eou__ Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan! __eou__ 
Thank you, friend. __eou__ Let's go. __eou__ 
Willow Ufgood. __eou__ Yes...? __eou__ I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom... __eou__ 
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to? __eou__ She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth. __eou__ 
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life. __eou__ Me? __eou__ 
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen. __eou__ What is Tir Asleen? __eou__ 
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel. __eou__ You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody. __eou__ You are very important, Willow. __eou__ No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn! __eou__ 
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers. __eou__ My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these... __eou__ 
They look like acorns. __eou__ Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone. __eou__ 
Sir!  I have to talk to you. __eou__ Not today, Willow. __eou__ It's a matter of great importance to me! __eou__ 
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow. __eou__ My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin. __eou__ 
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can. __eou__ If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this? __eou__ You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow. __eou__ I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you! __eou__ Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition. __eou__ 
Go in the direction the bird is flying. __eou__ Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad! __eou__ Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow... __eou__ 
You!  Are you the mother of that child? __eou__ No.  I mean yes. __eou__ 
I can't. __eou__ Let me see it. __eou__ 
I can't. __eou__ Why not? __eou__ Why not? __eou__ 
Gawd...you're...beautiful... __eou__ You're not a woman. __eou__ 
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman. __eou__ My step-father's going to tear you apart. __eou__ 
I do what I'm told. __eou__ Too bad you're not more like your father. __eou__ 
You're a fool.  Now put her back. __eou__ I'm not going to let this baby die. __eou__ 
Why did you say that? __eou__ Say what? __eou__ I love you. __eou__ 
Because it's true. __eou__ I don't believe you. __eou__ 
Sorsha. __eou__ Madmartigan. __eou__ 
We'll probably die here, Sorsha. __eou__ I have no family. __eou__ 
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here? __eou__ He's no magician. __eou__ He turned that monster into stone! __eou__ 
Then you get us out of here. __eou__ I will!  But I need help! __eou__ 
Who is that girl, anyway? __eou__ Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter. __eou__ 
We're a tiny version of all that? __eou__ As above, so below. __eou__ 
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell. __eou__ Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel? __eou__ 
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here. __eou__ Good.  How long will it take? __eou__ 
Don't make me angry, Peck. __eou__ You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that. __eou__ Miserable Pecks. __eou__ 
Do any other daikinis ever come by here? __eou__ Why. __eou__ I have to give this baby to some- body. __eou__ 
Hey!  Somebody's coming! __eou__ Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire! __eou__ 
Thanks for your help, Peck. __eou__ Are you okay? __eou__ As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies! __eou__ I don't know. __eou__ 
You a woodcutter? __eou__ Farmer. __eou__ Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world. __eou__ 
You all right? __eou__ These burns.  My arms.  Ouch... __eou__ 
Smells like a battle. __eou__ Are you a warrior? __eou__ The greatest swordsman that ever lived. __eou__ 
What's that?  I hear something! __eou__ You hear trouble. __eou__ What is it? __eou__ 
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole! __eou__ Friend of yours? __eou__ 
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow? __eou__ I hate this. __eou__ 
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own. __eou__ You don't know anything about ba- bies. __eou__ 
You gotta promise to feed her. __eou__ I will. __eou__ Fresh goat's milk. __eou__ Absolutely! __eou__ 
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed. __eou__ Of course!  I promise! __eou__ 
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that. __eou__ Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake. __eou__ 
You!! __eou__ Where the hell did you come from? __eou__ 
Hey!  Give me that baby! __eou__ These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids. __eou__ Nursemaid?! __eou__ 
Time to change her diaper. __eou__ Time to leave. __eou__ 
Because she's sick. __eou__ Because she's sick. __eou__ 
Where's the baby?? __eou__ I thought you had her! __eou__ 
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...! __eou__ Elora Danan! __eou__ 
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf! __eou__ Madmartigan!  You saved her life! __eou__ I did? __eou__ 
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist. __eou__ Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me. __eou__ The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides? __eou__ 
Madmartigan, I need your help. __eou__ My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help. __eou__ 
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king! __eou__ You? __eou__ Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream. __eou__ 
I'll help you...! __eou__ I won't. __eou__ 
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up. __eou__ The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan. __eou__ 
Did she ask about me? __eou__ Who? __eou__ Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything? __eou__ 
She said lots of thing.s __eou__ Willow! __eou__ 
She asked about you, Madmartigan. __eou__ Well what did she say? __eou__ 
She's in love. __eou__ You're crazy.  I think you're in love. __eou__ 
You? __eou__ What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents? __eou__ 
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places. __eou__ Want me to carry Elora? __eou__ I'm used to her.  How's she doing? __eou__ 
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong? __eou__ She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress. __eou__ She's a bird, Willow. __eou__ That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and-- __eou__ Watch it! __eou__ Ahhh! __eou__ 
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs. __eou__ Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture! __eou__ I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle... __eou__ 
I don't know, Willow. __eou__ Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her? __eou__ 
It's not a Nelwyn baby. __eou__ No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini... __eou__ 
Can't we keep it, Dada? __eou__ Absolutely not. __eou__ 
Dada, what's a daikini? __eou__ Daikinis are giant people who live far far away. __eou__ Are you scared? __eou__ 
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear! __eou__ What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep... __eou__ 
Who are you!  Who are you! __eou__ I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel. __eou__ 
What do you want! __eou__ We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess. __eou__ 
Kill him! __eou__ No! __eou__ Kill him! __eou__ 
Did *you* give that acorn its power? __eou__ No. __eou__ A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it. __eou__ 
You must learn magic. __eou__ That's all I ever wanted! __eou__ Then I will teach you. __eou__ 
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone! __eou__ What do I need for that? __eou__ We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair. __eou__ 
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this? __eou__ Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you... __eou__ I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it? __eou__ As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand. __eou__ 
I'm all finished.  Now what? __eou__ Burn it to a fine ash. __eou__ 
How am I gonna do that? __eou__ Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way. __eou__ 
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on! __eou__ I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality! __eou__ What's the magician's weapon? __eou__ The limitless power of... __eou__ 
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be? __eou__ I can't remember all these things. What am I learning? __eou__ The art of transformation! __eou__ 
But what am I gonna transform?? __eou__ Me! __eou__ 
Oooh, this smells terrible. __eou__ That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery! __eou__ 
Ouch!! __eou__ Shhhhh! __eou__ 
What'd you bit me for!! __eou__ We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy. __eou__ 
Again:  what is the magician's weapon? __eou__ His will. __eou__ Now use it. __eou__ 
I just wanted to test it first. __eou__ No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow. __eou__ 
Tir Asleen. __eou__ There's nobody here. __eou__ 
How?? __eou__ Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them! __eou__ 
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it! __eou__ More!  More! __eou__ 
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician! __eou__ You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me. __eou__ 
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself! __eou__ Why? __eou__ Just do it! __eou__ 
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die! __eou__ No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda! __eou__ She's too powerful, Raziel __eou__ 
Time is running out. __eou__ Surrender!! __eou__ 
Patience, Willow. __eou__ Courage, Willow. __eou__ 
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears. __eou__ Somebody has to do it. __eou__ 
Watch this.  Right between the eyes. __eou__ He never misses. __eou__ 
I'm not going in there. __eou__ Me neither! __eou__ 
Are you sure? __eou__ Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island! __eou__ 
We gotta follow them. __eou__ Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home. __eou__ 
Get back here, Rool! __eou__ Ouch!  Let go of me! __eou__ 
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying. __eou__ Shut up. __eou__ 
She needs to be changed. __eou__ I changed her already! __eou__ 
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire. __eou__ Who is that horrible friend of yours? __eou__ Madmartigan. __eou__ Who is he? __eou__ I don't know much about him. __eou__ 
She's hungry. __eou__ I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse. __eou__ Here.  Hold her. __eou__ 
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm. __eou__ Queen Cherlindrea? __eou__ She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess. __eou__ Who?? __eou__ You're the guardian, aren't you? __eou__ 
I'm getting her out of there! __eou__ No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool! __eou__ 
Ohhh, I hate this. __eou__ Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here. __eou__ Why not? __eou__ 
This is not going well. __eou__ Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do. __eou__ 
Talk!  Say something! __eou__ I can't see anything--she's too bright! __eou__ 
Hey, careful there! __eou__ How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin. __eou__ 
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold. __eou__ How are we going to get out there? __eou__ 
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel. __eou__ The sorceress. __eou__ 
Obviously. __eou__ Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go. __eou__ 
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal. __eou__ Queen Bavmorda transformed her. __eou__ 
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do? __eou__ Maybe milking. __eou__ Milking? __eou__ Cows. You know, cows? __eou__ I've seen pictures. __eou__ Good, you start tomorrow. __eou__ 
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before? __eou__ Not one this big. __eou__ 
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite? __eou__ Guess I'm not used to so much. __eou__ Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite. __eou__ 
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company __eou__ Sorry. It's important. __eou__ 
Where's Timmy and Buck? __eou__ Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think? __eou__ You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs? __eou__ That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred. __eou__ Oh sure, Fred. __eou__ 
Who are these orphans, anyway? __eou__ They're Amish. __eou__ 
Put my car in the garage and close the door. __eou__ John, I don't understand any of this. __eou__ You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy. __eou__ John, why?... __eou__ Just do it! __eou__ 
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about? __eou__ I thought I was the English. __eou__ English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain. __eou__ 
I came to see Rachel Lapp. __eou__ Try the house. __eou__ 
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book. __eou__ It's been a while. __eou__ No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter. __eou__ 
Your hole is healed, then? __eou__ Pretty much. __eou__ 
Nail it! __eou__ Yes, sir. __eou__ 
Everything is all right, John. __eou__ Pick up the hat. __eou__ 
I saw him. __eou__ Who'd you see? __eou__ 
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor? __eou__ No... I saw the man who killed him. __eou__ 
He was... like him. __eou__ Black... I understand. What else,Sam? __eou__ 
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel? __eou__ No pistol. Ever. __eou__ Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand. __eou__ Okay, Mr. Book. __eou__ 
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers. __eou__ You don't say. __eou__ 
Hey, Sam... __eou__ ...I want to say a thing. __eou__ What's that, Sam? __eou__ 
Is it them? __eou__ It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before. __eou__ Are they going to kill you? __eou__ Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there! __eou__ What are you going to do? __eou__ I'll be all right. You just do as I say. __eou__ 
Don't let them hurt you. __eou__ I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can! __eou__ 
Are you really ever coming back? __eou__ Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars. __eou__ Have you got your gun on now? __eou__ Sure have, Sam. __eou__ 
How reliable is this kid? __eou__ Oh, he's good. __eou__ Amish. __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ What have you got? __eou__ Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed. __eou__ So one of them got to him. __eou__ Maybe. __eou__ You know who? __eou__ Maybe. __eou__ You're still convinced there's a link to the department? __eou__ If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months. __eou__ That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy. __eou__ The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing. __eou__ When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department. __eou__ Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that. __eou__ What's-her-name moved to Buffalo. __eou__ Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife. __eou__ 
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it. __eou__ I hope you don't have any doubts about that. __eou__ If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum. __eou__ Who else knows? __eou__ Just us. __eou__ Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up __eou__ More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department. __eou__ Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you. __eou__ 
What's your first move? __eou__ A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days. __eou__ 
Who else knows? __eou__ Just us. __eou__ 
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out. __eou__ How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad. __eou__ I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you. __eou__ Johnny  __eou__ You might want to pass it along to Mac. __eou__ Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in  __eou__ I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you. __eou__ 
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer. __eou__ Don't try me, Johnny! __eou__ 
It's all over, Paul. __eou__ Move! Or you die right here! __eou__ 
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name? __eou__ Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon. __eou__ There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there. __eou__ 
Where are you taking us? __eou__ We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area. __eou__ You have no right to keep us here. __eou__ Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide. __eou__ You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws! __eou__ Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that. __eou__ It's not a joke. __eou__ 
What was that? __eou__ He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you. __eou__ 
Now what's the problem? __eou__ The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people. __eou__ 
Whacking? __eou__ Yes. And I also want to leave this city. __eou__ Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify. __eou__ We do not go into your courts. __eou__ People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail. __eou__ 
Look, I'm genuinely sorry... __eou__ No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much. __eou__ They kid a lot. __eou__ I would not be too sure. __eou__ 
But not a good tired. __eou__ What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired. __eou__ 
Your sister said you don't have a family? __eou__ No. __eou__ She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility. __eou__ 
Oh? Anything else? __eou__ Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows. __eou__ 
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman? __eou__ Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved. __eou__ 
But why would they murder... __eou__ Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops. __eou__ I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home. __eou__ You'll be safe. You don't have to worry. __eou__ 
Where are you taking us now? __eou__ Home. __eou__ You couldn't wait until morning? __eou__ 
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia. __eou__ I was wrong. __eou__ 
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast. __eou__ I can't. __eou__ What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial? __eou__ 
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital? __eou__ No, no doctor... __eou__ But why? __eou__ Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me. __eou__ But  __eou__ 
Who are they? __eou__ The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life. __eou__ Can I have something to drink? __eou__ 
Does anybody know I'm here? __eou__ Only the elders. __eou__ How long? __eou__ What? __eou__ How long have I been here? __eou__ Two days. __eou__ Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go. __eou__ But you can't. __eou__ 
Tell him his tea stinks. __eou__ You tell him. When you're able. __eou__ 
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible. __eou__ Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun - __eou__ It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel. __eou__ 
Enjoying your reading? __eou__ Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that? __eou__ Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these. __eou__ 
Your husband's? __eou__ Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers. __eou__ 
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes. __eou__ Something wrong with buttons? __eou__ Buttons are Hochmut. __eou__ Hochmut? __eou__ Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain. __eou__ Anything against zippers? __eou__ You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint. __eou__ Quaint? Can't imagine why. __eou__ 
Where's the nearest telephone? __eou__ Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even. __eou__ No. I'd want a public phone. __eou__ 
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while. __eou__ I'm going this morning. __eou__ But Stoltzfus said... __eou__ I know what he said. __eou__ You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry. __eou__ 
The... bullets? __eou__ Oh. The bullets. __eou__ 
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago. __eou__ Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler? __eou__ We had some lemonade and he left. __eou__ A real fireball. __eou__ 
You know carpentry? __eou__ I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school. __eou__ What else can you do? __eou__ I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking. __eou__ Whacking is not of much use on a farm. __eou__ Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job. __eou__ I'm sorry. I'm sure it is. __eou__ 
Sure. __eou__ But... You may not be well enough. __eou__ I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea. __eou__ 
When will you be going? __eou__ Not long... A few days. __eou__ 
Won him over just like that. __eou__ I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's. __eou__ 
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow. __eou__ I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun. __eou__ 
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed. __eou__ There was. __eou__ There was a time when I would have welcomed it. __eou__ I know. __eou__ I was being foolish? __eou__ No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life. __eou__ You're so sure of that? __eou__ Aren't you? After today? __eou__ I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours! __eou__ Oh, come on, Rachel. No way. __eou__ There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land! __eou__ Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do! __eou__ What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven! __eou__ That's your way, not mine. __eou__ That's God's way! __eou__ Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help! __eou__ 
I want you to take this... to remember by. __eou__ Where's my baggy pants? __eou__ Here. Whenever you want them. __eou__ 
Anybody know about this? __eou__ I didn't even know about it. __eou__ Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like? __eou__ 
I got there late, John. __eou__ Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens  __eou__ It won't happen again. __eou__ 
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight. __eou__ What the hell are you talking about? What's happening. __eou__ Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can. __eou__ Johnny, what the fuck? __eou__ Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it. __eou__ 
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual... __eou__ I hear you. __eou__ Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass. __eou__ 
It's me. __eou__ Johnny! Where the hell have you been? __eou__ Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I? __eou__ Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in. __eou__ I'm coming. __eou__ Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense. __eou__ 
You hear me? __eou__ I hear you. I'll stay in touch. __eou__ That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway? __eou__ 
Where I'm at is maybe 1890. __eou__ Say again? __eou__ Make that 1790. __eou__ 
You know where he is. __eou__ Wrong. __eou__ You'd lie to protect him. __eou__ Probably. __eou__ 
You admit you're lying? __eou__ I admit I don't know where he is. __eou__ You're the first one he'll contact. __eou__ He's got my number. __eou__ 
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know... __eou__ What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out... __eou__ 
Did you find him? __eou__ Not yet. __eou__ 
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position. __eou__ He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie! __eou__ Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name. __eou__ Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace! __eou__ Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him  __eou__ I don't know where he is. __eou__ But... if you had to guess? __eou__ 
Everything okay? __eou__ Yes, thank you very much. __eou__ John said you're Amish. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Oh. __eou__ 
Good morning. __eou__ You didn't have to... __eou__ I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish! __eou__ Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John. __eou__ 
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee. __eou__ You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work? __eou__ I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit. __eou__ 
What's so funny? __eou__ Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him. __eou__ God, Fred... __eou__ At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way. __eou__ No? Why not? __eou__ You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night. __eou__ Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay? __eou__ 
Who was that man? __eou__ His name is John Book. __eou__ 
Is the English dead? __eou__ No... __eou__ Looks dead... __eou__ 
That has no place in this house. __eou__ I know. __eou__ 
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws  __eou__ We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows! __eou__ Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands. __eou__ I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel. __eou__ 
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman. __eou__ Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter. __eou__ 
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung? __eou__ I have done nothing against the ordnung. __eou__ Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing? __eou__ I have committed no sin. __eou__ No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned! __eou__ That is idle talk. __eou__ Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child! __eou__ 
I am not a child. __eou__ You are acting like one! __eou__ I will be the judge of that. __eou__ No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me! __eou__ You shame yourself. __eou__ 
No, Rachel... __eou__ I have to help him! __eou__ 
Never seen anything like that in all my years. __eou__ He's from... Ohio... My cousin. __eou__ We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them. __eou__ John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant. __eou__ You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you? __eou__ Yes. Samuel! We're going. __eou__ 
She say where he is? __eou__ I don't think she knows. __eou__ 
What about Carter? __eou__ Tight. But I'm working on him. __eou__ Lean on him. __eou__ 
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into? __eou__ They don't have any shit. __eou__ 
He's not in this building. __eou__ All right, where is he? __eou__ 
No, you listen. Get out! __eou__ Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he? __eou__ You have no right here! __eou__ 
He'll live. __eou__ You might have killed him! __eou__ Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two. __eou__ 
Get back in there. __eou__ My son is out there! __eou__ Nobody's going to hurt your son... __eou__ 
Is this where we're going? __eou__ Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore. __eou__ 
Momma... are they angry with us. __eou__ No... No. It is just the English way. __eou__ 
I don't want to stay here. __eou__ They are English. They don't understand. __eou__ I wish dawdie was with us. __eou__ I know. Sleep now, Liebchen. __eou__ 
Aunt Em! __eou__ Fifty-seven, fifty-eight -- __eou__ Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She -- __eou__ Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight-- __eou__ Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the -- __eou__ 
Seventy --  Dorothy, please! __eou__ Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and -- __eou__ Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy! __eou__ Oh -- all right. __eou__ 
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna -- __eou__ Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing. __eou__ No -- __eou__ Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble. __eou__ 
Dorothy! __eou__ You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please! __eou__ 
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place -- __eou__ Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling. __eou__ Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you! __eou__ Yes, darling. __eou__ 
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days. __eou__ There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream. __eou__ No -- __eou__ 
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we -- __eou__ No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice.... __eou__ 
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with. __eou__ I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Oh, I hope we got them in time. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ 
Uhh -- yeah -- __eou__ Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go. __eou__ 
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white -- __eou__ Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it! __eou__ Well, Dorothy was walking along the -- __eou__ I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon! __eou__ All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and -- __eou__ Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers. __eou__ 
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally __eou__ But we've got to verify it legally To see... __eou__ To see? __eou__ If she... __eou__ If she? __eou__ Is morally, ethic'ly __eou__ 
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants! __eou__ If any! __eou__ Yes, let the joyous news be spread. __eou__ 
From now on you'll be history __eou__ You'll be hist... __eou__ 
Our echo. __eou__ Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo. __eou__ 
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard! __eou__ The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz! __eou__ 
...have you come back? __eou__ Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her. __eou__ Oh .... __eou__ 
...resourceful! __eou__ Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir. __eou__ Not so fast!  Not.... __eou__ 
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises! __eou__ Do you presume to criticize the.... __eou__ 
... -- Oz -- has spoken! __eou__ Who are you? __eou__ Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz. __eou__ You are? __eou__ 
Uhhhh -- yes... __eou__ I don't believe you! __eou__ No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me. __eou__ 
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug! __eou__ Oh .... __eou__ 
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe! __eou__ Ohhh! __eou__ Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum! __eou__ 
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back! __eou__ I can't come back!  I don't know how it works! __eou__ Oh -- __eou__ Goodbye, folks! __eou__ 
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her. __eou__ Well, gee, I try and have a heart. __eou__ Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented. __eou__ This? __eou__ Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it! __eou__ Oh! __eou__ Who did it? Now wait a minute. __eou__ Hickory! __eou__ Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that. __eou__ 
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help! __eou__ Are you all right, Dorothy? __eou__ Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke -- __eou__ 
...didn't you? __eou__ No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!.... __eou__ 
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me! __eou__ All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time. __eou__ Oh, please give me back my dog! __eou__ Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers. __eou__ But the Good Witch of the North told me not to. __eou__ Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him! __eou__ 
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto. __eou__ That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason. __eou__ 
Ahh!  Ah! __eou__ I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog? __eou__ No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as... __eou__ 
Run, Toto, run! __eou__ Catch him, you fool! __eou__ 
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch? __eou__ Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas. __eou__ Oh!  Well.... __eou__ 
Toto's my dog. __eou__ Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all... __eou__ 
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East. __eou__ Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins? __eou__ The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out. __eou__ 
I thought you said she was dead. __eou__ That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was. __eou__ 
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear. __eou__ Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came. __eou__ No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself! __eou__ The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked? __eou__ Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you? __eou__ No, I'm afraid I didn't. __eou__ Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West. __eou__ But, how do I start for Emerald City? __eou__ It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road. __eou__ 
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me? __eou__ You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas. __eou__ I have? __eou__ 
...Toto, too? __eou__ Toto, too. __eou__ Oh, now? __eou__ Whenever you wish. __eou__ Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye. __eou__ 
Are you ready now? __eou__ Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto. __eou__ 
Yes, I'm ready now. __eou__ Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times. __eou__ 
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home." __eou__ There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home. __eou__ 
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away. __eou__ How did you guess? __eou__ Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away? __eou__ Why -- __eou__ No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans -- __eou__ Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me. __eou__ 
Yes -- __eou__ Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you? __eou__ 
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh? __eou__ Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you. __eou__ Oh -- __eou__ Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me. __eou__ Aw, come, come, come -- __eou__ No, they won't - honestly. __eou__ Oh -- __eou__ Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe? __eou__ Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's.... __eou__ 
That's our farm! __eou__ Oh -- yes. __eou__ 
...her face is careworn. __eou__ Yes...That's Aunt Em. __eou__ Her -- her name is Emily. __eou__ 
That's right.  What's she doing? __eou__ Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying. __eou__ Oh -- __eou__ Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart. __eou__ Me? __eou__ 
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute. __eou__ Uh-huh. __eou__ What's she doing now? __eou__ 
...room -- __eou__ Has it poppies on the wall.... __eou__ 
...paper? __eou__ I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the.... __eou__ 
...bed. __eou__ Oh, no -- no! __eou__ That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark. __eou__ Oh, you.... __eou__ 
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away! __eou__ But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me. __eou__ Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right.... __eou__ 
Oh --  __eou__ But you couldn't have been, could you? __eou__ 
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed. __eou__ Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you? __eou__ 
Now you're seeing reason. __eou__ No -- __eou__ Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again. __eou__ Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself! __eou__ 
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have... __eou__ Stop her! __eou__ 
Oil can.....Oil can.... __eou__ Did you say something? __eou__ Oil can.... __eou__ 
Where do you want to be oiled first? __eou__ My mouth -- my mouth! __eou__ 
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows. __eou__ Oh... __eou__ 
Oh -- __eou__ ...Oh, did that hurt? __eou__ No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh --- __eou__ Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this? __eou__ Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain.... __eou__ 
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since. __eou__ Well, you're perfect now. __eou__ My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it! __eou__ Oh --! __eou__ 
Oh -- __eou__ All hollow.  Oh -- __eou__ 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right? __eou__ I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet. __eou__ Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart. __eou__ Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way. __eou__ 
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there? __eou__ Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already.  __eou__ Ohh -- what's that? Oh -- __eou__ 
Oh! They're - they're gone now. __eou__ Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you? __eou__ I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers. __eou__ Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me! __eou__ Oh - I'll get it! __eou__ Oh! Oh! __eou__ 
Oh -- __eou__ Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee! __eou__ Oh-oh- __eou__ 
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time. __eou__ Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we? __eou__ 
We might. __eou__ Oh -- __eou__ 
And bears! __eou__ What sort of an animal is that? __eou__ It-it-it-it - it's a huge one! __eou__ 
And him a brain. __eou__ I'm sure he could give you some courage. __eou__ 
Can't that female take no for an answer? __eou__ Oh -- __eou__ 
Oh, he's just ascared again. __eou__ Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage? __eou__ 
No.  Why only --  Oh -- __eou__ Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh! __eou__ 
Oh! Something bit me, too! __eou__ Now come on - you're acting silly --  __eou__ 
Dorothy! __eou__ I knew you would! __eou__ 
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now. __eou__ You've had plenty of time already! __eou__ 
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen! __eou__ Yes...! __eou__ 
...yes. __eou__ Look -- it ticks! __eou__ 
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking. __eou__ Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage. __eou__ 
Oh, my! __eou__ Lions and tigers and bears! __eou__ Oh, my! __eou__ Lions and tigers and bears! __eou__ Oh, my! __eou__ Lions and tigers and bears! __eou__ Oh, my! __eou__ Lions and tigers and bears! __eou__ Oh, my!  __eou__ 
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him. __eou__ No, but you tried to. __eou__ 
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs -- __eou__ Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding? __eou__ Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward! __eou__ You're right -- I am a coward. __eou__ 
...has been simply unbearable. __eou__ Oh. __eou__ Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard -- __eou__ 
A home -- __eou__ The nerve. __eou__ 
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that! __eou__ Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for? __eou__ 
Yes -- let's run! __eou__ Yes. __eou__ 
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it? __eou__ Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick! __eou__ 
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho __eou__ Hah! __eou__ 
Who's her?  Who's her? __eou__ It's the Witch!  She's followed us here! __eou__ 
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important. __eou__ And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion. __eou__ 
I'll be home in time for supper! __eou__ In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If.... __eou__ 
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything? __eou__ Not nobody, not nohow! __eou__ 
How about a hippopotamus? __eou__ Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus! __eou__ Supposin' you met an elephant? __eou__ I'd wrap him up in cellophant! __eou__ 
I'd be too scared to ask him for it. __eou__ Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you. __eou__ I'd sooner wait outside. __eou__ But why?  Why? __eou__ Because I'm still scared! __eou__ Oh, come on. __eou__ Ohh! __eou__ 
Oh -- Oh, come on. __eou__ Huh?  What'd he say? __eou__ 
Does it work? __eou__ No, but it's wonderful for threatening with. __eou__ Oh -- __eou__ 
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird. __eou__ It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees. __eou__ 
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation. __eou__ Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror? __eou__ I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer. __eou__ 
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto! __eou__ Did they hurtcha? __eou__ Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come! __eou__ 
They're coming back! __eou__ Ohhh! __eou__ 
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth! __eou__ Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful. __eou__ 
Oh, now I'll never get home! __eou__ Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go. __eou__ Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do? __eou__ 
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you. __eou__ I think I'll miss you most of all. __eou__ 
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all. __eou__ I have so got brains. __eou__ Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See? __eou__ Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all. __eou__ Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know. __eou__ 
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am! __eou__ What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you? __eou__ 
...don't talk. __eou__ It's pleasant down that way, too. __eou__ 
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm -- __eou__ Oh, well, here -- let me help you. __eou__ Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind. __eou__ 
...yes. __eou__ Ohhhh -- __eou__ Ohh! __eou__ 
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again! __eou__ Oh -- does it hurt you? __eou__ Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again. __eou__ Ohhh -- __eou__ My, it's good to be.... __eou__ 
...free! __eou__ Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh! __eou__ Did I scare you? __eou__ No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself. __eou__ 
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces! __eou__ They would? __eou__ Um-hmm. __eou__ Where's Kansas? __eou__ That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me. __eou__ You're going to see a Wizard? __eou__ Um-hmm. __eou__ Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains? __eou__ I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now. __eou__ Yes -- that's true. __eou__ But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble. __eou__ Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match. __eou__ I don't blame you for that. __eou__ But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you? __eou__ 
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard! __eou__ Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well. __eou__ Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will. __eou__ To Oz? __eou__ To Oz! __eou__ 
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas. __eou__ Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm! __eou__ 
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself. __eou__ Oh -- __eou__ 
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin! __eou__ What? __eou__ Yes.  Oh -- look -- __eou__ 
Oil can what? __eou__ Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is! __eou__ 
He said his mouth. __eou__ Here -- here -- __eou__ The other side.... __eou__ Yes --- there. __eou__ 
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart. __eou__ And I'll keep the oil-can handy. __eou__ 
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble. __eou__ Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you? __eou__ 
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I? __eou__ I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you? __eou__ 
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy! __eou__ Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter. __eou__ Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals? __eou__ 
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too? __eou__ I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart. __eou__ 
...along. __eou__ Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto! __eou__ 
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up! __eou__ Oh -- __eou__ 
Yes -- there -- __eou__ Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up. __eou__ 
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one. __eou__ Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been -- __eou__ 
Dear, whatever shall we do? __eou__ Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard! __eou__ 
Oh -- __eou__ Looks like we came a long way for nothing. __eou__ Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home! __eou__ 
Oh -- Oh -- __eou__ Oh -- are you -- are you all right? __eou__ 
Oh, come on now - everybody --  __eou__ Did you just hear what I just heard? __eou__ 
No -- No -- No -- No! __eou__ Ohh!  OHH!  OHH! __eou__ Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help! __eou__ 
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me! __eou__ Leave her alone! __eou__ You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,.... __eou__ 
...ting the ruby slippers? __eou__ The slippers -- yes.....the slippers! __eou__ 
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll --- __eou__ It's too late!  There they.... __eou__ 
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well! __eou__ Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too. __eou__ Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way.... __eou__ 
Real courage. That's what we want. __eou__ You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me. __eou__ 
Yeah. __eou__ Ah -- __eou__ Dorothy next! __eou__ Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor -- __eou__ 
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair. __eou__ It did? __eou__ 
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad. __eou__ Don't you start it, too! __eou__ 
What if it were a brontosaurus? __eou__ I'd show him who was King of the Fores'! __eou__ 
Would...would it do any good if I roared? __eou__ Who at? __eou__ I don't know. __eou__ 
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside. __eou__ What's the matter? __eou__ 
What happened? __eou__ Somebody pulled my tail. __eou__ Oh, you did it yourself! __eou__ I -- Oh -- __eou__ Here --   Come on. __eou__ What was that? __eou__ 
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they? __eou__ Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy! __eou__ 
I've got a plan how to get in there. __eou__ Fine.  He's got a plan __eou__ And you're going to lead us. __eou__ Yeah. Me? __eou__ Yes, you. __eou__ I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there? __eou__ That's right. __eou__ All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do. __eou__ 
Up! __eou__ Now... __eou__ 
Come on -- I've got another idea. __eou__ Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this? __eou__ 
Stop pushing! __eou__ Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh! __eou__ 
Where -- where do we go now? __eou__ This way!  Come on! __eou__ 
You humbug! __eou__ Yeah! __eou__ 
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why!  __eou__ Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone! __eou__ Oh, scared, huh? __eou__ 
I haven't slept in weeks. __eou__ Why don't you try counting sheep? __eou__ That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em. __eou__ 
Dorothy! __eou__ Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field! __eou__ 
Not even a rhinoceros? __eou__ Imposserous! __eou__ 
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with. __eou__ She - she can have my Witch Remover. __eou__ 
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away!  __eou__ Hold still - hold still -- __eou__ 
It's a whatzis. __eou__ It's a whatzis? __eou__ Whozat? __eou__ Whozat? __eou__ 
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles. __eou__ Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already. __eou__ Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again. __eou__ 
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins. __eou__ Yeah -- __eou__ 
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out. __eou__ I hope your tail holds out. Oh -- __eou__ 
No?  Now, wait a minute. __eou__ You don't neither -- __eou__ 
Where do we go now? __eou__ Yeah. __eou__ 
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! __eou__ Don't push! __eou__ 
You don't get around us that easy! __eou__ Not nohow! __eou__ 
Mr. Gale! __eou__ Howdy, Miss Gulch. __eou__ I want to see you and your wife right away.... __eou__ 
... about Dorothy. __eou__ Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done? __eou__ What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg! __eou__ You mean she bit you? __eou__ No, her dog! __eou__ Oh, she bit her dog, eh? __eou__ NO! __eou__ 
...Tin Man! __eou__ Ohhhh -- it's me! __eou__ 
...junk! __eou__ Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and -- __eou__ Quiet! __eou__ Ohhhhhh! __eou__ 
...of the West. __eou__ B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it! __eou__ 
Beautiful!  What an echo! __eou__ It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart. __eou__ 
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah! __eou__ I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that? __eou__ 
No, sir! __eou__ No, sir! __eou__ 
That's right. __eou__ We do. __eou__ To Oz? __eou__ To Oz! __eou__ 
Animals that -- that eat straw? __eou__ Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears. __eou__ 
I'd be gentle as a lizard -- __eou__ I'd be clever as a gizzard -- __eou__ 
Then I'm sure to get a brain -- __eou__ A heart -- __eou__ 
Come on -- come on -- __eou__ Hurry -- hurry -- __eou__ 
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on! __eou__ Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful! __eou__ Emerald City! __eou__ 
Hey, Dorothy! __eou__ Dorothy! __eou__ 
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy! __eou__ Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again! __eou__ 
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy. __eou__ I don't think I could, but we could try. __eou__ Let's. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible! __eou__ Here, Tin Man -- help me. __eou__ 
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is! __eou__ It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP! __eou__ It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help! __eou__ 
Ha -- ha -- ha -- __eou__ Ho -- ho --ho __eou__ 
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain! __eou__ I can fairly hear my heart beating! __eou__ 
Oh, did - did you see that? __eou__ Oh - look out. __eou__ You know something? __eou__ 
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry! __eou__ I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation. __eou__ 
It's a whozis. __eou__ It's a whozis? __eou__ 
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! __eou__ Oh!  Well, what happened to you? __eou__ They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there! __eou__ Well, that's you all over. __eou__ 
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this! __eou__ Now, now, don't fret. __eou__ Oh, dear, dear. __eou__ We'll get you together! __eou__ 
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy. __eou__ But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's.... __eou__ 
...to Dorothy! __eou__ Oh -- __eou__ Come on, fellows! __eou__ 
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out.  __eou__ Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is. __eou__ 
No, you don't. __eou__ Oh, no! __eou__ 
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it? __eou__ You put up a great fight, Lion. __eou__ Yeah -- __eou__ I don't know what we'd have done without you. __eou__ 
Oh - upstairs, quickly! __eou__ Go on! __eou__ 
Hey -- what about Dorothy? __eou__ Yes -- how about Dorothy? __eou__ 
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous! __eou__ It makes you nervous? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ 
What about us? __eou__ Well, I -- __eou__ What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --? __eou__ Well, I -- __eou__ -- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion? __eou__ Well, I -- __eou__ 
Well -- __eou__ You promised us real things -- a real... __eou__ 
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D. __eou__ Th.D.? __eou__ 
How can I ever thank you enough? __eou__ Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious.... __eou__ 
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart. __eou__ But I still want one. __eou__ Yes -- .... __eou__ 
Stop that dog! __eou__ This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented! __eou__ Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up! __eou__ 
-- Ruined my exit! __eou__ Help! __eou__ 
You new? __eou__ Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...? __eou__ Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all. __eou__ Dont know any doctor jokes. __eou__ 
What happened to Len Tashka? __eou__ Couldnt make it. Splitting headache. __eou__ The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun. __eou__ 
He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom. __eou__ Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them. __eou__ 
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing. __eou__ So who are you? __eou__ Bond -- __eou__ 
They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb. __eou__ With this? __eou__ 
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner? __eou__ When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens. __eou__ Alright then, brunch. __eou__ 
The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core! __eou__ Then its no longer a bomb? __eou__ Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off... __eou__ 
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us! __eou__ I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it. __eou__ What the hell are you talking about? __eou__ Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium. __eou__ Whos she? __eou__ Elektra King. __eou__ Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline. __eou__ Makes her look even more innocent. __eou__ What would she want with weapons grade plutonium? __eou__ I was hoping you could tell me. __eou__ 
What is it? __eou__ She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet. __eou__ 
Nuclear. __eou__ Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown. __eou__ Made to look just like an accident. __eou__ 
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe... __eou__ Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world... __eou__ The King pipeline. __eou__ Elektra would control it all. __eou__ 
Zukovsky... __eou__ If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead. __eou__ 
Is there another way? __eou__ We go down to the torpedo bay. __eou__ 
Hes sealed himself in. __eou__ Hes going to insert the plutonium. __eou__ 
Do you know what youre doing? __eou__ Like riding a bike. __eou__ 
What kind of bikes did you ride? __eou__ Just wanted to put him on edge... __eou__ 
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink. __eou__ But what if... __eou__ Count to twenty.  Ill be there. __eou__ 
Weve got to get out. __eou__ We cant. __eou__ 
I love Christmas in Turkey. __eou__ So isnt it time you unwrapped your present? __eou__ 
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action. __eou__ I need you to pass me fit now, Molly. __eou__ 
Its just a scratch. __eou__ James.  It wouldnt really be... __eou__ 
Then maybe Id be... open to that. __eou__ Perhaps after this ... test? __eou__ ...yes?... __eou__ I could come for a second opinion? __eou__ 
Constructions not exactly my line. __eou__ Quite the opposite, in fact. __eou__ 
Old friend? __eou__ Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity. __eou__ Who buys classified reports for three million pounds. __eou__ 
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into. __eou__ Shes not a girl anymore. __eou__ 
Ive scheduled a medical for you. __eou__ Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall. __eou__ Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose. __eou__ 
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea? __eou__ Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it. __eou__ And now its up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought. __eou__ 
Who told you to look at Elektras files? __eou__ I took the initiative. __eou__ You havent been given an assignment in this case. __eou__ I was the one who brought that money in... __eou__ Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it. __eou__ The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra. __eou__ 
Its a message.  He wants us to know hes back. __eou__ Who? __eou__ Claude Serrault.  A.K.A... __eou__ Renard. __eou__ 
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him. __eou__ Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist? __eou__ How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again. __eou__ 
He survived? __eou__ The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man. __eou__ 
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man. __eou__ That which does not kill me makes me stronger. __eou__ Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge. __eou__ Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you. __eou__ 
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that. __eou__ The worm on the hook again. __eou__ 
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead. __eou__ Then Robert was right about a Russian connection. __eou__ Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin... __eou__ The inside man? __eou__ Is maybe...the inside woman. __eou__ 
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position.. __eou__ Which is neutral, no doubt. __eou__ 
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent. __eou__ Who did you get it from? __eou__ I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner... __eou__ And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss. __eou__ Your last chance. Take the money. __eou__ Your last chance. Give me the name. __eou__ Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me? __eou__ 
The name? __eou__ I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me! __eou__ 
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty. __eou__ Indeed. __eou__ 
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it. __eou__ Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune. __eou__ 
Who is it? __eou__ You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed... __eou__ 
You will never touch her. You will never get near her. __eou__ Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva? __eou__ Consider me ungrateful. __eou__ Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair. __eou__ Shell get over it. __eou__ You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you. __eou__ 
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already. __eou__ Havent you heard the news?  So is she. __eou__ 
Beautiful, isnt it? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ 
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine. __eou__ Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs. __eou__ A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover. __eou__ You knew him well? __eou__ 
He was my father. __eou__ Im sorry. __eou__ He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him. __eou__ 
I met you at my fathers funeral. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now. __eou__ Funerals arent exactly memorable. __eou__ God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that. __eou__ Is that why you want to finish the pipeline? __eou__ Partially, yes. __eou__ 
Who is he? __eou__ My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette. __eou__ How long has he been with you? __eou__ Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask? __eou__ 
Does this look familiar to you? __eou__ Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life. __eou__ 
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women? __eou__ Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company. __eou__ If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third... __eou__ 
The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over... __eou__ Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed. __eou__ I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter. __eou__ You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it. __eou__ 
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back. __eou__ Always wanted to see the upper lines. __eou__ You dont take no for an answer, do you? __eou__ No. __eou__ 
Oh my God...were buried alive... __eou__ Were alright. __eou__ 
I cant stay here. __eou__ Youre not going to. __eou__ 
No!  It will cave in! __eou__ Its the only way out... __eou__ 
I cant stay. __eou__ I know. __eou__ 
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward. __eou__ I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met. __eou__ 
What is it? __eou__ ...you should rest. __eou__ 
James... __eou__ I have to go. __eou__ Then take me with you. __eou__ No. Youll be safe here. __eou__ I dont want to be safe! __eou__ I have to go to work. __eou__ 
Vodka martini. __eou__ Two. Shaken not stirred. __eou__ 
What the hell are you doing here? __eou__ Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one? __eou__ 
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now. __eou__ You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill. __eou__ 
I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end. __eou__ Really? __eou__ 
Surely you believe in living dangerously. __eou__ Not at that price. Time to surrender. __eou__ 
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this. __eou__ Shush. __eou__ 
How did you survive? __eou__ I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that. __eou__ 
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy? __eou__ A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto? __eou__ What are you talking about? __eou__ Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard? __eou__ ...what? __eou__ We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me... __eou__ 
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me? __eou__ You can drop the act, its over. __eou__ I dont know what youre talking about! __eou__ I think you do. __eou__ 
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out. __eou__ He used your exact words. __eou__ You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike? __eou__ 
Im coming with you. __eou__ You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now. __eou__ 
I could have given you the world. __eou__ Not interested. __eou__ 
Wheres M? __eou__ Soon shell be everywhere. __eou__ 
All this, because you fell for Renard? __eou__ Five more turns and your neck will break. __eou__ 
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance. __eou__ You turned Renard. __eou__ Just like you...only you were even easier. __eou__ 
So you killed your father. __eou__ He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom. __eou__ 
Was this all about the oil? __eou__ It is my oil!  Mine and my familys! __eou__ 
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people. __eou__ No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident. __eou__ 
Know what happens when a man is strangled? __eou__ Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die. __eou__ 
One... last... screw? __eou__ Oh James. __eou__ 
Valentin Zukovsky. __eou__ BondJamesBond. What brings you here? __eou__ You, of course. I need some information. __eou__ Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble... __eou__ Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest. __eou__ Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House. __eou__ 
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want? __eou__ How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons? __eou__ What?  This is not possible. __eou__ 
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division. __eou__ Where did you get this? __eou__ Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me. __eou__ 
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive. __eou__ How high up does this...arms dealing go? __eou__ Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you. __eou__ But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline. __eou__ 
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing? __eou__ Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant. __eou__ Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship. __eou__ 
Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears? __eou__ Whats your business with Elektra King? __eou__ I thought you were the one in her business. __eou__ She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for? __eou__ As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks. __eou__ 
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined! __eou__ You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard. __eou__ 
Now...where were we? __eou__ A rope! __eou__ No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for? __eou__ 
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff. __eou__ And the payoff on the tables? __eou__ A special job.  A...a...a submarine. __eou__ 
Wheres the sub going?! __eou__ No!  Get me out! __eou__ This is too big for even you.  Where is it? __eou__ This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out! __eou__ 
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people. __eou__ Where? __eou__ Istanbul. __eou__ 
Mother of God. __eou__ The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea. __eou__ 
The Maidens Tower. __eou__ How appropriate. __eou__ Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years. __eou__ 
What? __eou__ To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet. __eou__ 
No! Bond! __eou__ Bond! __eou__ 
What is this place? __eou__ Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit. __eou__ 
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo. __eou__ What class sub does your nephew run? __eou__ C-class. __eou__ 
Ill send someone out. __eou__ Could...could you come? __eou__ 
Perhaps this isnt the time... __eou__ Please. __eou__ 
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market. __eou__ Your father... __eou__ Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back. __eou__ 
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you. __eou__ Someone will come. __eou__ Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead. __eou__ 
Warm. __eou__ Is it? __eou__ 
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm. __eou__ How would you know? __eou__ 
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted. __eou__ Of course... __eou__ 
He was a...good lover? __eou__ What do you think? __eou__ 
This is the end. __eou__ No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same. __eou__ 
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready? __eou__ Yes.  Au revoir... __eou__ 
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure. __eou__ And expensive.  Cost three million plus. __eou__ 
Do we have the range of Renards plane? __eou__ Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan... __eou__ Marvellous. __eou__ 
The parcels in the post. __eou__ Its heading for the oil terminal. __eou__ Where it can do the most damage. __eou__ 
Any word from him? __eou__ Still no contact yet. __eou__ 
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door. __eou__ Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me. __eou__ Why?  What's the problem? __eou__ I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent. __eou__ I would like to use the bathroom -- __eou__ 
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore. __eou__ What?! __eou__ Please. __eou__ 
What about our end? __eou__ Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through. __eou__ 
What kind of time frame are we talking about? __eou__ Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order. __eou__ 
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt. __eou__ What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory? __eou__ We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather. __eou__ The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions. __eou__ 
Had a lot of blood in him. __eou__ You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse. __eou__ No idea who's behind this? __eou__ Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight. __eou__ 
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington. __eou__ Washington? __eou__ They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU. __eou__ 
Walter -- __eou__ Don't call me that. __eou__ Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear. __eou__ Wrong answers? __eou__ There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you. __eou__ Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day. __eou__ 
A whore fucking. __eou__ Who is she?  Do you know her? __eou__ 
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open? __eou__ Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog. __eou__ 
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge? __eou__ God isn't there to do it. __eou__ We don't know that. __eou__ 
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you -- __eou__ Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate? __eou__ 
Hi, Jon. __eou__ Hello, Adrian. __eou__ 
The bearer of bad news. __eou__ We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead. __eou__ 
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen. __eou__ Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad. __eou__ What's your theory? __eou__ Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me. __eou__ 
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon. __eou__ You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting. __eou__ 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT? __eou__ Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand. __eou__ 
Blake?  Dead? __eou__ Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol. __eou__ 
I'm here, Laurie. __eou__ Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral? __eou__ Not yet, there's plenty of time. __eou__ 
Would you like me to stay? __eou__ Mm hmm. __eou__ I could stay and go. __eou__ . . . And just how would you manage that? __eou__ 
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you. __eou__ Collect me? __eou__ In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . . __eou__ Jon, no -- I can't -- __eou__ It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it. __eou__ 
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind. __eou__ Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we -- __eou__ 
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time? __eou__ Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg. __eou__ You -- you know about me and Dan? __eou__ 
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms. __eou__ Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg? __eou__ Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised. __eou__ That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds. __eou__ 
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once? __eou__ Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you. __eou__ Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me. __eou__ I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did. __eou__ But you knew that I'd -- die. __eou__ Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that. __eou__ 
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known. __eou__ Always.  Ever since the day I died. __eou__ 
Then why don't you . . . do something about it! __eou__ Because -- __eou__ Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it? __eou__ I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years. __eou__ 
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people. __eou__ Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see. __eou__ 
Jon, I do not want to hear it. __eou__ I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . . __eou__ Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you. __eou__ You're the only human being I care for. __eou__ Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me. __eou__ I won't do that. __eou__ You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please. __eou__ I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens. __eou__ Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it. __eou__ 
What -- am I -- __eou__ Cured, yes. __eou__ 
Its very strange.  Times flowing backwards . . . __eou__ Jon -- what?? __eou__ The south pole.  Times flowing backwards. __eou__ 
Jon, where are we? __eou__ Veidts complex. __eou__ 
Jon -- __eou__ Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now. __eou__ Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see? __eou__ I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe! __eou__ 
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know. __eou__ My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach? __eou__ It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us. __eou__ Us.  You mean the Watchmen. __eou__ 
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood. __eou__ You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over. __eou__ He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date. __eou__ If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money? __eou__ No.  I just wanted you to -- __eou__ You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night. __eou__ Good night. __eou__ 
Who? __eou__ I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay? __eou__ She's with me. __eou__ Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me. __eou__ Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know. __eou__ 
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . . __eou__ The missing scientists. __eou__ Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats. __eou__ 
What?? __eou__ I couldn't let him interfere with my project. __eou__ 
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan. __eou__ Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape? __eou__ It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen. __eou__ 
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits. __eou__ What is it?  How does it work? __eou__ It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own -- __eou__ Adrian -- you've lost it. __eou__ I've seen them!  I've seen them in there.  __eou__ 
Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we? __eou__ And what if youre wrong? __eou__ Im not. __eou__ What if youre wrong?? __eou__ Then Ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me.  Christ!  Im doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!! __eou__ 
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered. __eou__ You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world? __eou__ We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time. __eou__ 
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you? __eou__ Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa. __eou__ Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . . __eou__ Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time. __eou__ Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations -- __eou__ 
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices. __eou__  __eou__ 
Damn straight. __eou__ Damn straight!  We were heroes. __eou__ Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits. __eou__ Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . . __eou__ Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . . __eou__ Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up? __eou__ That's the one.  Whatever happened to him? __eou__ He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft. __eou__ 
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie? __eou__ Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live. __eou__ You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . . __eou__ 
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen. __eou__ Maybe not, but why take chances? __eou__ Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and -- __eou__ 
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about -- __eou__ No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay. __eou__ You're sure? __eou__ 
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or -- __eou__ I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay? __eou__ 
His what? __eou__ His . . . whatever. __eou__ I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay? __eou__ 
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal. __eou__ I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people. __eou__ Play one.  Educate yourself. __eou__ 
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff? __eou__ Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old! __eou__ I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it? __eou__ I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . . __eou__ Old? __eou__ Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one. __eou__ . . . What? __eou__ Pick a record.  I feel like dancing. __eou__ 
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that. __eou__ Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial. __eou__ 
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong? __eou__ The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach. __eou__ 
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone? __eou__ One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared. __eou__ 
-- What is it. __eou__ I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around. __eou__ Laurie -- __eou__ I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me -- __eou__ With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours. __eou__ 
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we? __eou__ Memory lane. __eou__ 
The Owlship.  I can't believe it. __eou__ -- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check. __eou__ 
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica. __eou__ Antarctica?? __eou__ Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war. __eou__ Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left. __eou__ You and me. __eou__ 
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them. __eou__ Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract. __eou__ 
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around. __eou__ What are you up to? __eou__ Don't look.  Turn around. __eou__ 
This'd better not be what I think it is. __eou__ Okay! __eou__ 
What the hell -- ? __eou__ It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd. __eou__ Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No. __eou__ 
They're following us. __eou__ All right.  Mission accomplished. __eou__ 
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high! __eou__ I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested. __eou__ They're practically on us . . . __eou__ That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried. __eou__ 
What? __eou__ The costumes.  Am I right? __eou__ 
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert. __eou__ Yes you are. __eou__ No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years. __eou__ That's because -- __eou__ It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it. __eou__ 
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing? __eou__ Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him. __eou__ . . . What?? __eou__ 
What's he doing? __eou__ I think he's going to the john. __eou__ My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a -- __eou__ 
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude. __eou__ Will you two lovebirds keep it down? __eou__ 
Welcome back, Night Owl. __eou__ What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian? __eou__ 
What was he doing? __eou__ Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world -- __eou__ 
He saved himself.  He changed the past. __eou__ Where did he go? __eou__ 
Dan, is this -- is this New York?? __eou__ Those cars.  What year is this?? __eou__ Everything's changed -- __eou__ 
Dan -- what do we do now? __eou__ Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together -- __eou__ We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ? __eou__ 
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see. __eou__ Did anybody follow you?  See you come here? __eou__ 
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it. __eou__ Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead. __eou__ 
So do I.  So do you. __eou__ Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia. __eou__ 
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word. __eou__ Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right? __eou__ 
. . . That was quick. __eou__ Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here. __eou__ 
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian. __eou__ Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me. __eou__ What new information? __eou__ Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . .  __eou__ 
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up. __eou__ What do you mean, frame-up? __eou__ Obvious pattern -- all ties in -- __eou__ Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer? __eou__ 
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . . __eou__ Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break -- __eou__ 
Where's Laurie? __eou__ I don't think she's coming with us. __eou__ 
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's. __eou__ Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just -- __eou__ Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter. __eou__ Coward.  Giving up. __eou__ SHUT UP, Rorschach. __eou__ 
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie. __eou__ Okay, let's just . . . thank you. __eou__ 
What happened? __eou__ The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave. __eou__ What caused it? __eou__ Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast. __eou__ 
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in? __eou__ He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us. __eou__ Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and -- __eou__ 
. . . And they call me a fucking nut. __eou__ Adrian.  Its too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here. __eou__ 
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak. __eou__ With lots of ketchup? __eou__ 
Nothing wrong with ketchup. __eou__ Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this? __eou__ Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something -- __eou__ We should get back --  What? __eou__ Nothing.  What were you going to say? __eou__ We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon? __eou__ 
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the -- __eou__ Janey, will you marry me? __eou__ 
I can fix it. __eou__ -- What? __eou__ My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever. __eou__ 
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me? __eou__ Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors -- __eou__ No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen. __eou__ Oh sweetheart, just a quick one. __eou__ No.  We laid out very careful ground rules -- __eou__ 
No comment. __eou__ Did you know he was back on the streets? __eou__ I did not.  Now get out of my way! __eou__ Isn't it true that you -- __eou__ 
Their real names, please. __eou__ I don't know their real names. __eou__ You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk. __eou__ I don't know their real names! __eou__ You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan -- __eou__ Then why don't you ask him?!? __eou__ 
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer. __eou__ What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive? __eou__ 
I'm terribly sorry. __eou__ What does this mean?  What does it -- __eou__ Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends. __eou__ That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me -- __eou__ 
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things. __eou__ Am I free to go? __eou__ You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it. __eou__ I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit -- __eou__ Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out. __eou__ Jon??  You mean he's -- __eou__ That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet. __eou__ 
Adrian. __eou__ Laurie!  Good to see you. __eou__ 
Don't rub it in.  I live here. __eou__ And how's life with the walking H-bomb? __eou__ He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat. __eou__ 
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I -- __eou__ I'll take a raincheck, Laurie. __eou__ Please. __eou__ 
He's a little farther gone every time. __eou__ Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams. __eou__ Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world. __eou__ I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work -- __eou__ What about you? __eou__ I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards. __eou__ 
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you. __eou__ Maybe I'll do that. __eou__ I'm sorry about Blake. __eou__ 
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy. __eou__ Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch. __eou__ You're making a big -- __eou__ 
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon. __eou__ ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me? __eou__ 
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with -- __eou__ Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU. __eou__ CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think -- __eou__ Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back. __eou__ 
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs. __eou__ No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you. __eou__ 
New information. __eou__ Ever see one of these before? __eou__ Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up. __eou__ What is that ungodly smell? __eou__ 
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . . __eou__ Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad. __eou__ Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press. __eou__ 
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . . __eou__ Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world. __eou__ 
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III. __eou__ No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer. __eou__ 
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt. __eou__ Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at. __eou__ 
Who the hell are you? __eou__ The name's Gibbons. You were saying? __eou__ What is this place? __eou__ Looks like a diner. __eou__ Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why? __eou__ 
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same. __eou__ That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway? __eou__ Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character. __eou__ Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit. __eou__ It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy. __eou__ A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch. __eou__ Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge? __eou__ ..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy. __eou__ Why is that? __eou__ Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble. __eou__ Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years. __eou__ Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking. __eou__ You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me. __eou__ Is that a fact? __eou__ Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea. __eou__ You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God. __eou__ You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests. __eou__ 
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class. __eou__ You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there. __eou__ Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me. __eou__ 
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution. __eou__ You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy. __eou__ You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help. __eou__ I'm not interested. I've already got a job. __eou__ You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger. __eou__ I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead. __eou__ That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge. __eou__ 
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for? __eou__ There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people. __eou__ What do I get out of it? __eou__ If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath. __eou__ You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along. __eou__ 
Not bad for a gimp. __eou__ What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head. __eou__ 
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack? __eou__ Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear? __eou__ Yeah, I spy or I die. __eou__ 
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports. __eou__ Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5. __eou__ 
Up yours. __eou__ Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene. __eou__ 
Is that all? __eou__ Just remember, I'll be watching. __eou__ 
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars. __eou__ If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X. __eou__ Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money. __eou__ One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars! __eou__ I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not? __eou__ We're not after car thieves here. __eou__ What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick. __eou__ That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period. __eou__ Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too? __eou__ My friend, if you're planning on crossing me... __eou__ I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out. __eou__ 
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that? __eou__ Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac. __eou__ This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab". __eou__ Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember? __eou__ I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today. __eou__ 
Thanks. __eou__ You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work. __eou__ You ain't seen nothing yet. __eou__ 
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual. __eou__ I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest? __eou__ They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you? __eou__ Yes it does. __eou__ Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that. __eou__ Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity. __eou__ Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with? __eou__ Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back. __eou__ Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules. __eou__ Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now. __eou__ We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill. __eou__ 
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you. __eou__ I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet? __eou__ You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent. __eou__ But I hate cops, remember? Except for her. __eou__ Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys. __eou__ Who says you're the good guys? __eou__ 
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside. __eou__ Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles? __eou__ On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric? __eou__ No needles, huh? What about the acid bath? __eou__ All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing. __eou__ You're a jerk-off, you know that? __eou__ 
What do you have? __eou__ Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life. __eou__ He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost. __eou__ They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands. __eou__ Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys __eou__ We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it. __eou__ How will you fix it? __eou__ I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own. __eou__ So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven. __eou__ You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop. __eou__ 
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde... __eou__ The scum of the Earth. __eou__ But programmable. And expendable. __eou__ I've seen enough. Turn it off. __eou__ 
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over. __eou__ That's exactly why we need them. __eou__ 
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time. __eou__ I think we should send him whatever he wants. __eou__ You what? A wire transfer of this size? __eou__ If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely. __eou__ You're talking about a very expensive risk here. __eou__ He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen. __eou__ Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you? __eou__ 
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad. __eou__ So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that. __eou__ 
Whatchu doing here? __eou__ Oh, I don't know. It was an accident. __eou__ That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard. __eou__ 
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys? __eou__ We're anti-social. We don't have any friends. __eou__ 
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'. __eou__ You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling. __eou__ Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest. __eou__ Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that? __eou__ 
What game is that? __eou__ Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses. __eou__ Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers. __eou__ You wanna check it out? Come here. __eou__ 
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade. __eou__ Naturally. __eou__ 
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'. __eou__ Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons. __eou__ 
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99. __eou__ "Anarchy" 99"? __eou__ What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash. __eou__ What weapons do you have? __eou__ 
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through. __eou__ What do you get if you finish? __eou__ Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive. __eou__ Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it. __eou__ Like what? __eou__ He gets to be the hero. __eou__ 
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S. __eou__ I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max. __eou__ 
Do you know what a wire transfer is? __eou__ Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation. __eou__ My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot. __eou__ Sure. Just chisel some off your heart. __eou__ So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife. __eou__ 
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing? __eou__ Yorgi asked me to. __eou__ You do everything Yorgi says? __eou__ Go to hell. __eou__ It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that? __eou__ Mind your business. __eou__ Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you. __eou__ 
Where are you going? __eou__ Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home. __eou__ I was invited. What's your story? __eou__ I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions. __eou__ 
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you. __eou__ Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type. __eou__ That right? Why's that? __eou__ 
Who are you? __eou__ We hung out last night, remember? __eou__ I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for? __eou__ Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck. __eou__ 
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets. __eou__ You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid. __eou__ 
Hey, you're good. __eou__ Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are. __eou__ That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who? __eou__ 
I don't know what you're talking about. __eou__ The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra. __eou__ Go to hell! __eou__ Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal. __eou__ 
What are you? __eou__ I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it? __eou__ 
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil. __eou__ I'm from L.A. __eou__ So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan? __eou__ Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that. __eou__ Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much. __eou__ Don't judge a comic book by it's cover. __eou__ You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you. __eou__ I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound. __eou__ Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it? __eou__ The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business. __eou__ All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts. __eou__ We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it. __eou__ A beach named X? That I'd like to see. __eou__ So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out? __eou__ 
They tell me you're an American agent. __eou__ What are you talking about? __eou__ There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true. __eou__ It's a long story, but yeah, more or less. __eou__ Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people. __eou__ If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me. __eou__ That's alright, I'll figure something out. __eou__ Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down. __eou__ 
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse. __eou__ They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now. __eou__ 
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what? __eou__ No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece. __eou__ We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that? __eou__ There's something I didn't have time to tell you before. __eou__ What's that? __eou__ I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year. __eou__ You're what? What the hell have you been doing? __eou__ I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal. __eou__ I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger. __eou__ 
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you. __eou__ Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here. __eou__ Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice. __eou__ When can I see you again? __eou__ You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember? __eou__ 
Are you alright? __eou__ What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me! __eou__ I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room. __eou__ I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF. __eou__ 
What are you doing with the Ivans? __eou__ I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now. __eou__ 
Where are we going? __eou__ We're getting out of this place. We've done enough. __eou__ Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent? __eou__ It doesn't matter anymore, forget it. __eou__ Of course it matters. Hey, hold on! __eou__ What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me. __eou__ Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that. __eou__ No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander? __eou__ We can't leave now. We have to do something. __eou__ Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said. __eou__ 
They left. To a fortress in the mountains. __eou__ We'll have to go after them. __eou__ Aren't you afraid? __eou__ A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine. __eou__ I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi. __eou__ You don't have to do that. __eou__ Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside. __eou__ Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been? __eou__ I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt. __eou__ When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation. __eou__ What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet. __eou__ 
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three. __eou__ He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool. __eou__ 
Yorgi and Kirill. __eou__ Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them. __eou__ 
Did you do your homework? __eou__ If they launch it, I know how to bring it back. __eou__ Let's do this. __eou__ 
Where's he headed? __eou__ He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there. __eou__ 
Where'd the damn truck go?! __eou__ Go to the water, it's that way! __eou__ 
Toadies right behind. __eou__ Let me. __eou__ 
You okay? __eou__ A piece of shrapnel hit me. __eou__ I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice. __eou__ 
He's shut out the communication circuit! __eou__ You can't talk to it? __eou__ No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls. __eou__ A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better. __eou__ 
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots. __eou__ It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right? __eou__ By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate! __eou__ Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater! __eou__ 
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself. __eou__ You can't welch on me now. We had a deal. __eou__ 
What are you doing? __eou__ It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed. __eou__ 
Nothing. He had two days. __eou__ Perhaps he is not all he says he is. __eou__ 
What are you doing? __eou__ It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident. __eou__ 
What was that for? __eou__ I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together. __eou__ You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared. __eou__ Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline. __eou__ Viktor! Stay the course. __eou__ 
The Peace conference... __eou__ Nice place to start, don't you think? __eou__ 
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s. __eou__ That's would be me. __eou__ 
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up. __eou__ I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people. __eou__ Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest. __eou__ Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt. __eou__ Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir. __eou__ 
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface. __eou__ They come in any other styles or colors? __eou__ 
This is your standard dart gun. __eou__ That one I'm real familiar with. __eou__ 
I think I'll hang on to these. __eou__ Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list. __eou__ 
From the Beastie Boys collection? __eou__ It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute. __eou__ You're joking, right? __eou__ 
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail. __eou__ I thought that was in detail. __eou__ 
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation... __eou__ I'm through, Xander. __eou__ I can see that. Why? __eou__ You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore. __eou__ I'm having fun, what's the problem? __eou__ You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that. __eou__ I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money... __eou__ 
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there? __eou__ Alright, so I'll get more. __eou__ It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability. __eou__ Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now. __eou__ 
What...? __eou__ I was gonna wait till the islands, but... __eou__ You're serious? __eou__ Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I? __eou__ This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind? __eou__ I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is. __eou__ You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere. __eou__ You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself. __eou__ You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now. __eou__ 
Sit down. __eou__ I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand. __eou__ 
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you. __eou__ Here we go again. __eou__ You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our. __eou__ First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest. __eou__ 
Nice hops. __eou__ The corner. Anarchy 99. __eou__ 
I'll leave you two alone to talk. __eou__ Yeah, thanks a lot. __eou__ 
Dude, what are you doing here? __eou__ You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been? __eou__ 
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash. __eou__ Is this what you're looking for? __eou__ 
Sorry, "dude". __eou__ What's the deal? __eou__ Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out? __eou__ Why you dogging me up? __eou__ They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor. __eou__ 
What's so damn funny? __eou__ Been to any good diners lately? __eou__ 
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back? __eou__ A parachute. This does not argue well. __eou__ 
Who's writing this dude's dialogue? __eou__ He's a pretty good actor, though. __eou__ 
Help me with this guy. __eou__ It's like you said, every man for himself. __eou__ 
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on? __eou__ Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war. __eou__ 
That's the guy. __eou__ This pizda? Never seen him before. __eou__ Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead? __eou__ 
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out? __eou__ He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink. __eou__ I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house. __eou__ 
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them. __eou__ Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about. __eou__ I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does? __eou__ 
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour. __eou__ When else are you gonna do it? __eou__ 
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for? __eou__ Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start. __eou__ 
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details. __eou__ It'll work faster if I have an account number. __eou__ 
Very nice. I'm impressed. __eou__ I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem... __eou__ 
I had to inspect the merchandise first. __eou__ Of course. __eou__ 
What's this? __eou__ This is a gift. From me to you. __eou__ 
What's going on, my friend? __eou__ You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what? __eou__ He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you. __eou__ Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of. __eou__ 
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street! __eou__ Had to do what I had to do. __eou__ 
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99! __eou__ What's "Anarchy 99"? __eou__ It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours. __eou__ You wanna see my politics? __eou__ 
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money. __eou__ That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born. __eou__ 
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..." __eou__ "...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals. __eou__ You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man. __eou__ How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere? __eou__ Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss. __eou__ 
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live. __eou__ It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me. __eou__ I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg. __eou__ You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well? __eou__ Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen. __eou__ Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere. __eou__ My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch. __eou__ 
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl. __eou__ That's alright, I'm kinda tired. __eou__ You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one. __eou__ 
That was for Anders. __eou__ Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run. __eou__ 
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much? __eou__ I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls. __eou__ Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is. __eou__ 
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche. __eou__ You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves. __eou__ So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world. __eou__ Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want. __eou__ Including rape, pillage, murder. __eou__ Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it. __eou__ And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt. __eou__ Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it. __eou__ 
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of -- __eou__ Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked. __eou__ 
What does that mean? __eou__ The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions. __eou__ 
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power. __eou__ ... until he found tungsten. __eou__ 
I wish I could go. __eou__ We all do. __eou__ Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to-- __eou__ Beast. __eou__ 
Can the Professor repair his own mind? __eou__ I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro. __eou__ 
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core. __eou__ Its core? __eou__ 
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration. __eou__ For what purpose? __eou__ Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it. __eou__ So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration? __eou__ 
Scott.. I - __eou__ I don't like him being here. __eou__ What are you talking about? __eou__ You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake. __eou__ If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something. __eou__ 
What's wrong with him? __eou__ His vital signs are weak and getting weaker. __eou__ 
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid. __eou__ We have to find Magneto. __eou__ 
Are you all right? __eou__ No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles. __eou__ 
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous. __eou__ Well, I think that's perfectly understandable. __eou__ I'll tell you one thing though. __eou__ What's that? __eou__ He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him. __eou__ 
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down. __eou__ Into the Hudson? __eou__ Uh-huh. __eou__ 
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there? __eou__ It's too far. __eou__ Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here. __eou__ 
Jean... can you? __eou__ I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough. __eou__ 
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here? __eou__ I wanted to talk to you. __eou__ 
How long have you been in Alaska? __eou__ I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me? __eou__ 
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight? __eou__ You know, you -- __eou__ Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men. __eou__ 
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k. __eou__ Sure you are, sport. __eou__ 
Anything else I can get you? __eou__ Some cigars.  Case of beer. __eou__ There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds. __eou__ I won't light the cigars - how about that? __eou__ I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while. __eou__ What if I like the pain? __eou__ 
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary. __eou__ Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past. __eou__ Maybe, the Professor could help you with that. __eou__ By reading my thoughts? __eou__ If necessary. __eou__ What if they're naughty? __eou__ 
You should always work with a spotter. __eou__ He's busy right now. __eou__ 
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town. __eou__ Were you now? __eou__ What do you say? __eou__ Not interested. __eou__ 
Let go. __eou__ Suit yourself. __eou__ 
He's uptight. __eou__ He takes his work seriously. __eou__ He takes himself seriously. __eou__ What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me? __eou__ 
Logan, do you see this ring? __eou__ I've seen a lot of rings. __eou__ Yeah, I'll bet you have. __eou__ 
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous? __eou__ I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous. __eou__ 
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants? __eou__ Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics -- __eou__ You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to -- __eou__ Control, Senator...  we teach them control. __eou__ 
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee - __eou__ I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator. __eou__ I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes. __eou__ 
Dr. Grey. __eou__ Senator? __eou__ 
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would... __eou__ Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us. __eou__ Tell it to the ones that did this to me. __eou__ 
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change. __eou__ I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes. __eou__ 
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry? __eou__ Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator. __eou__ You mutant bastards... __eou__ 
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed. __eou__ Gosh, I hope so. __eou__ 
The intention of registration act - __eou__ INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth. __eou__ 
What is it you intend to do to me? __eou__ Let's just say, God works too slowly. __eou__ 
I do love a good check mate. __eou__ What do you want? __eou__ Come with me and I'll let her live. __eou__ You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here. __eou__ 
Where am I? __eou__ You're backstage at the encore of creation. __eou__ 
What are you going to do? __eou__ In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine? __eou__ 
What am I doing here? __eou__ I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto. __eou__ Who? __eou__ A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay. __eou__ 
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you. __eou__ Deal. __eou__ 
The point of what? __eou__ This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what? __eou__ 
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings. __eou__ What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery. __eou__ 
Now that's Magneto talking. __eou__ No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me. __eou__ I believe he wants you for your Adamantium. __eou__ 
Where are we going? __eou__ To find Rogue. __eou__ How? __eou__ The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being. __eou__ 
You designed this yourself? __eou__ Actually, Magneto helped me put it together. __eou__ He helped you? __eou__ We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago. __eou__ 
I've found her, Westchester Mall. __eou__ I'll go. __eou__ 
Don't you knock? __eou__ They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone? __eou__ Actually I'm feeling up to leaving. __eou__ 
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will... __eou__ What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here. __eou__ 
Why is everybody up at sunrise? __eou__ The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours. __eou__ What did she do to me? __eou__ She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered. __eou__ I felt like she almost killed me. __eou__ If she held on any longer she could have. __eou__ And you think it helps calling her Rogue? __eou__ 
I lost him. __eou__ How? __eou__ It was Xavier's people.  They knew. __eou__ 
Is that what you're looking for? __eou__ A piece.  Only a piece. __eou__ Is it enough? __eou__ Enough for a test. __eou__ 
I'll find him. __eou__ ALIVE. __eou__ 
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles. __eou__ And I'll never understand terrorists. __eou__ I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same. __eou__ Not at the cost of lives, Max. __eou__ 
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro? __eou__ What do you want with him? __eou__ 
Is that so? __eou__ Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively. __eou__ You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days? __eou__ Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me. __eou__ 
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be. __eou__ The way what is going to be? __eou__ I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat. __eou__ What do you mean to do? __eou__ 
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice. __eou__ WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO? __eou__ 
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed... __eou__ I know. __eou__ 
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away? __eou__ It does indeed, Max. __eou__ And what do you do when you wake up to that? __eou__ I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble. __eou__ 
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor? __eou__ Yes, my dear, he is. __eou__ And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence? __eou__ He is the fifth leading authority in his field. __eou__ Oh, shit. __eou__ Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey. __eou__ 
Frederick Frankenstein? __eou__ You have the wrong house. __eou__ And who might you be? __eou__ Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen. __eou__ The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'? __eou__ No! __eou__ What was your grandfather's name? __eou__ Victor Frankenstein. __eou__ 
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you? __eou__ Ugly, vicious rumous. __eou__ 
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that? __eou__ Poppycock! __eou__ 
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out? __eou__ Now wait a minute! __eou__ 
Where did you get this cauliflower? __eou__ From your office, sir. __eou__ Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture? __eou__ Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up. __eou__ Are you trying to make me look like an idiot? __eou__ 
No, sir.  It will never happen again. __eou__ Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me. __eou__ 
Give him an extra dollar. __eou__ Yes, sir. __eou__ 
Yes, sir. __eou__ He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being. __eou__ 
Carlson! __eou__ Yes, sir? __eou__ Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant. __eou__ Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower? __eou__ ... No! __eou__ 
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place? __eou__ I did, sir. __eou__ 
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come. __eou__ Was he aware of the importance of this occasion? __eou__ Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University. __eou__ What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein? __eou__ 'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.' __eou__ 
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions! __eou__ Yes, sir. __eou__ I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done! __eou__ 
What in God's name are you doing? __eou__ Baack! __eou__ What? __eou__ Baack! __eou__ 
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you? __eou__ MMMmmmm. __eou__ All right then... seven's always been my lucky number. __eou__ 
MMMmm! __eou__ Is it that music? __eou__ MMMMM!  MMMMM! __eou__ Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about. __eou__ 
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies. __eou__ MMmmm. __eou__ 
Still happy you married me? __eou__ MMmmm. __eou__ Love me oodles and oodles? __eou__ MMmmm. __eou__ So this is what it's like to be completely happy! __eou__ MMmmm. __eou__ 
Darling! __eou__ Hello...? __eou__ Surprised? __eou__ Well... yes. __eou__ Miss me? __eou__ I... __eou__ 
Darling!...you will be careful!? __eou__ Of course. __eou__ You have your tickets? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ And your passport? __eou__ Yes, don't worry. __eou__ Call me from New York before you leave?? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ Promise?? __eou__ I promise. __eou__ Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away. __eou__ Oh, darling -- so will I. __eou__ 
Will you miss me? __eou__ Very....very! __eou__ Mother's going to help me with the invitations. __eou__ Oh, nice. __eou__ I hope you like large weddings. __eou__ Whatever makes you happy. __eou__ I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand. __eou__ You're incorrigible! __eou__ Does that mean you love me? __eou__ You bet your boots it does. __eou__ 
I will!  Goodbye, darling! __eou__ Goodbye, darling. __eou__ 
Goodbye, darling. __eou__ Goodbye, darling! __eou__ 
Darling! __eou__ Darling! __eou__ 
Surprised? __eou__ Surprised! __eou__ Love me? __eou__ Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in? __eou__ 
Darling!?! __eou__ I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor. __eou__ 
Ready, darling? __eou__ Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all. __eou__ Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor? __eou__ 
What a strange fellow. __eou__ Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though. __eou__ Why does he call you 'master'? __eou__ 
Are you suggesting I call him master??? __eou__ No, of course not.  I just meant... __eou__ All right then! __eou__ 
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body. __eou__ Darling, you mustn't worry so. __eou__ 
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system. __eou__ But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling. __eou__ Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir? __eou__ You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest. __eou__ I suppose you're right. __eou__ Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy. __eou__ 
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night? __eou__ Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you. __eou__ Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything. __eou__ 
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off. __eou__ Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours?? __eou__ That's a tough choice. __eou__ Is it worth taking a chance? __eou__ I suppose you're right. __eou__ Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy. __eou__ 
Good night. __eou__ That's my good boy. __eou__ 
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room. __eou__ It seems fine. __eou__ You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here. __eou__ Does that include the key to the laboratory? __eou__ 
You mean... the laboratory?? __eou__ Yes!... the laboratory. __eou__ No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate. __eou__ May I have it, please? __eou__ 
There seem to be quite a few books. __eou__ Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library. __eou__ I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library? __eou__ I don't know what you mean, sir. __eou__ well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study. __eou__ This is the only library I know of. __eou__ Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place? __eou__ I think you must be mistaken, sir. __eou__ 
Well... we'll see. __eou__ Will there be anything else? __eou__ I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of? __eou__ I put her in the guest room, just down the hall. __eou__ Good. __eou__ 
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss? __eou__ This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment. __eou__ Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight. __eou__ 
Dr. Frankenstein? __eou__ Fron kon steen! __eou__ My name is Gerhart Falkstein. __eou__ 
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune. __eou__ But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations. __eou__ Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir? __eou__ 
How long will this whole thing take? __eou__ A week.  Ten days at most. __eou__ I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and... __eou__ 
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it. __eou__ Why did you do that? __eou__ What? __eou__ Break that old man's violin. __eou__ I didn't do that. __eou__ The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee. __eou__ 
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive? __eou__ Yes, sir. __eou__ One week at the most!? __eou__ One week -- I'll see to it, sir. __eou__ Well, thank you very much for all your trouble. __eou__ 
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor. __eou__ Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there. __eou__ Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey! __eou__ 
That's 'Fronkonsteen.' __eou__ I beg your pardon? __eou__ My name is pronounced Fron kon steen. __eou__ Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein. __eou__ No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen! __eou__ But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism? __eou__ That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo! __eou__ 
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions. __eou__ Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses. __eou__ Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed? __eou__ 
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave? __eou__ Dr. Fronkonsteen! __eou__ Yes? __eou__ 
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion? __eou__ A piece of what? __eou__ Vermicelli. __eou__ Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti. __eou__ 
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts? __eou__ My father was a sick man. __eou__ But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you? __eou__ You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind. __eou__ 
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death? __eou__ How old are you, young man? __eou__ Nineteen, sir. __eou__ Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead. __eou__ But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys! __eou__ Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System. __eou__ But, sir... __eou__ I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher. __eou__ 
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system, __eou__ But your grandfather's work, sir... __eou__ My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE! __eou__ 
Frederick Frankenstein? __eou__ Fron kon steen! __eou__ Are you putting me on? __eou__ No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen. __eou__ And do you also say Fro dereck? __eou__ No, Fred ereck. __eou__ Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen? __eou__ It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen. __eou__ I see. __eou__ You must be Igor. __eou__ 
No, it's pronounced Aye gor. __eou__ But they told me it was Ee gor. __eou__ Well, they were wrong then, weren't they? __eou__ You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you? __eou__ 
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs. __eou__ I'm sure we will. __eou__ This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily. __eou__ How do you do? __eou__ 
Are these your bags? __eou__ Yes, just the two. __eou__ 
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump. __eou__ What hump? __eou__ 
There. __eou__ I beg your pardon? __eou__ There wolf!  There castle! __eou__ Why are you talking like that? __eou__ I thought you wanted to. __eou__ No. __eou__ 
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers. __eou__ What wockers? __eou__ The wockers with the knockers. __eou__ Wockers with the knockers??? __eou__ Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers. __eou__ 
Home! __eou__ Home. __eou__ 
Down!  Get down, you beasts! __eou__ I wonder what's got into them? __eou__ 
Aye-gor! __eou__ Fro-derick! __eou__ What are you doing here? __eou__ I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here. __eou__ 
But what you were doing? __eou__ Just putting up some tea. __eou__ Did you hear that strange music? __eou__ What? __eou__ Did you hear that strange music?? __eou__ What? __eou__ Did you hear that strange music? __eou__ 
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all? __eou__ What? __eou__ You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place? __eou__ Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first. __eou__ 
Did you see anyone else down here? __eou__ No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door. __eou__ 
What is this place? __eou__ Must be the music room. __eou__ 
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this! __eou__ 'How I Did It.'  Good title! __eou__ Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is? __eou__ 
Taking the book along? __eou__ Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh. __eou__ 
What a filthy job! __eou__ Could be worse! __eou__ How? __eou__ Could be raining! __eou__ 
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do! __eou__ I have a pretty good idea. __eou__ 
Do you have the name I wrote down? __eou__ Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck. __eou__ I want that brain. __eou__ Was he any good? __eou__ Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century. __eou__ 
Hmm! __eou__ And he wrote seventeen cookbooks. __eou__ That's not bad. __eou__ Can you imagine that brain in this body? __eou__ I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there? __eou__ He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body. __eou__ Oh!  May I call you 'Master'? __eou__ Why? __eou__ It's always been one of my favorite names. __eou__ If you like -- just hurry! __eou__ Thank you, Master. __eou__ 
You're sure you know what you're doing? __eou__ Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down! __eou__ Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios. __eou__ 
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain. __eou__ All right... elevate me! __eou__ 
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows. __eou__ Tonight? __eou__ Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch! __eou__ You've got it, master. __eou__ 
Throw the second switch! __eou__ This guy means business. __eou__ 
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me? __eou__ What? __eou__ More, do you hear me? __eou__ What? __eou__ Throw the third switch! __eou__ Wait till he sees the bill. __eou__ 
You can't win 'em all. __eou__ But there must be a reason. This is science, not art. __eou__ 
Cold!  Cold and dead! __eou__ You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day. __eou__ 
Don't try to cheer me up that way. __eou__ Well, I don't like to see you mope. __eou__ 
You'll be getting me sad next. __eou__ I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down. __eou__ 
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way. __eou__ You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner. __eou__ 
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent. __eou__ Who are you talking to? __eou__ To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert. __eou__ I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was. __eou__ But you did -- I just heard it. __eou__ It wasn't me. __eou__ 
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you. __eou__ I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case. __eou__ 
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps. __eou__ Don't fall for that one. __eou__ But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it. __eou__ careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps. __eou__ 
Original. __eou__ Give -- me -- your -- hand! __eou__ 
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with. __eou__ You can say that again. __eou__ Yes. __eou__ You're just supposed to repeat what you said. __eou__ Why? __eou__ 
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said. __eou__ I'm not trying to be funny. __eou__ 
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue. __eou__ ... I'm glad that's... __eou__ No, no!  That whole thing! __eou__ ... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with. __eou__ 
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks. __eou__ Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can. __eou__ Yes, Master! __eou__ Act casual! __eou__ 
How's it going? __eou__ What did you find out? __eou__ Someone was playing this in the music room. __eou__ 
Where is he? __eou__ How do you know it was a 'he'? __eou__ All right -- where is she? __eou__ How do you know it was a 'she'? __eou__ Bring -- me -- the -- violin! __eou__ Can you play it? __eou__ Maybe...if you get here on time. __eou__ 
Thanks...for all your help. __eou__ That's what we're paid for. __eou__ 
I'm a failure. __eou__ Come on, Froderick -- none of that. __eou__ 
What monster? __eou__ What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement. __eou__ 
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee. __eou__ What??? __eou__ He's carrying her off now through the woods. __eou__ 
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum... __eou__ That sound good, boss. __eou__ ... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid... __eou__ I like your style, master.  How do we get him here? __eou__ There's only one way. __eou__ I'll bet it's a doozy. __eou__ 
Come on, big fellow! __eou__ Is everything ready? __eou__ Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it? __eou__ It's the only way. __eou__ Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing. __eou__ 
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!? __eou__ It's alive! __eou__ 
Hello there. __eou__ MMMMMmmmmmmm. __eou__ How's everything? __eou__ MMMmmmmmmmm. __eou__ I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that? __eou__ MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm! __eou__ Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready? __eou__ 
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name? __eou__ ... It's. __eou__ 
Get the sedative ready! __eou__ MMmmm!  MMmmm! __eou__ 
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz! __eou__ Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits......................... __eou__ Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz! __eou__ Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper. __eou__ Soo -- pah doo -- per. __eou__ 
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm. __eou__ ...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts......................... __eou__ 
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm! __eou__ For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!! __eou__ 
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM! __eou__ Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now?? __eou__ 
MMMmmmmmm. __eou__ Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together? __eou__ 
What's that tune that you're playing __eou__ Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby. __eou__ How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune. __eou__ 
May I see your violin? __eou__ It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin? __eou__ Oh, just a little. __eou__ 
Nice!  Nice little balance to it. __eou__ Ja, ja. __eou__ 
Extremely well. __eou__ How nice. __eou__ 
Did you have a pleasant trip? __eou__ Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad. __eou__ 
Did you ever have a roll in the hay? __eou__ I'm not sure I...get your drift. __eou__ 
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning. __eou__ Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of. __eou__ 
Are you busy? __eou__ That's quite all right.  What is it, dear? __eou__ Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep. __eou__ We only arrived a few minutes ago. __eou__ I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room. __eou__ Well... __eou__ Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room. __eou__ Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while. __eou__ 
Would you like a sandwich? __eou__ No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep. __eou__ Well... I'll just finish unpacking. __eou__ 
Inga! __eou__ Yes, you may... but don't make any noise. __eou__ Inga, wake up! __eou__ What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor? __eou__ Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music? __eou__ Yes!  What could it be at this hour? __eou__ I don't know.  It just woke me up. __eou__ 
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look! __eou__ Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see. __eou__ Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone. __eou__ All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound! __eou__ 
Ooh! __eou__ What a filthy mess. __eou__ 
Look, Doctor! __eou__ Well, this explains the music. __eou__ But who was playing it? __eou__ 
Oh, doctor! __eou__ Perhaps we'd better leave. __eou__ 
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything. __eou__ And look at this, Doctor! __eou__ 'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.' __eou__ 
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine. __eou__ Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a... __eou__ A god? __eou__ Yes! __eou__ I know. __eou__ 
Right here? __eou__ Raise the platform, hurry! __eou__ Oh!  Yes, Doctor. __eou__ 
Reputation.  Reputation! __eou__ I thought it was wonderful. __eou__ I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter. __eou__ 
It wasn't me. __eou__ Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me... __eou__ 
Oh, Doctor! __eou__ I think you've done it, master. __eou__ Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death! __eou__ 
It looks that way. __eou__ What do you think we should do? __eou__ 
What are you going to do? __eou__ I think I'll...carry him. __eou__ 
Do you think you can sing it? __eou__ Me?  Sing? __eou__ Yes -- quickly, dear! __eou__ 
I'd be so nervous. __eou__ This is not the finals -- just sing! __eou__ It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.' __eou__ 
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...' __eou__ Stop -- singing!!! __eou__ 
All right -- give it to him! __eou__ Are you serious?? __eou__ Give him the sedative! __eou__ Oh!  Yes, Doctor. __eou__ 
Did you do it? __eou__ I think so. __eou__ Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds. __eou__ 
Good night, Doctor. __eou__ Good night! __eou__ 
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you. __eou__ Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible! __eou__ 
Just passing through the night. __eou__ What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely. __eou__ Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you. __eou__ I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor. __eou__ 
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately? __eou__ Not fooling around. __eou__ I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually? __eou__ I see what you mean. __eou__ There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear. __eou__ I know Frederick. __eou__ 
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth. __eou__ Of course not. __eou__ 
What? __eou__ I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me. __eou__ Nor to Elizabeth. __eou__ No.  Nor to Elizabeth. __eou__ We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours. __eou__ 
And Elizabeth has hers. __eou__ Yes, Elizabeth has hers. __eou__ But, after all, you have yours. __eou__ 
Yes, I have mine. __eou__ And I have mine. __eou__ 
Yes...yes, you have yours. __eou__ Why don't we talk inside? __eou__ Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes. __eou__ 
Yes, I know. __eou__ It wouldn't be fair to her. __eou__ Yes, I know. __eou__ You've got to help me to remain faithful. __eou__ Yes, I will. __eou__ ...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything! __eou__ 
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart? __eou__ MMmmm. __eou__ 
MMMMmmmmm! __eou__ Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe. __eou__ 
Are you ready for me? __eou__ MMMMmmmmm! __eou__ Ready for Fuchsmachen??? __eou__ MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm! __eou__ I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you. __eou__ 
Sweetheart.....Is this really you??? __eou__ MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! __eou__ 
No, not sound. __eou__ There must have been someone else down here then. __eou__ 
His what?? __eou__ His schwanzstucker. __eou__ Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill. __eou__ 
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully. __eou__ Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'? __eou__ 
I'm getting tired. __eou__ Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day. __eou__ 
Look how far we've come. __eou__ You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night. __eou__ I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor? __eou__ Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher? __eou__ 
How do you know they're done? __eou__ The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed. __eou__ 
How long is it so far? __eou__ Four __eou__ Three minutes to go! __eou__ Yes. __eou__ What d'ya want to do to kill time? __eou__ Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well. __eou__ 
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night? __eou__ Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth. __eou__ 
 __eou__ Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in. __eou__ 
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty. __eou__ Igor -- the clock!  Hurry! __eou__ 
Another fifteen seconds to go. __eou__ Do Something!  Stall them! __eou__ 
Yes, sir, name, please? __eou__ Food! __eou__ Do you have a reservation? __eou__ Food!! __eou__ I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation. __eou__ 
Drink! __eou__ Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo. __eou__ 
Foooooood! __eou__ Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip? __eou__ GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN! __eou__ Franz!  Help!  Lunatic! __eou__ 
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir? __eou__ I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye? __eou__ From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t __eou__ So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken. __eou__ 
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? . __eou__ Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!.... __eou__ You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster? __eou__ One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing! __eou__ 
Why don 't the Zulus attack? __eou__ Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses. __eou__ 
An historical moment, Gentlemen. __eou__ Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord. __eou__ 1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir __eou__ Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross. __eou__ Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory? __eou__ They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord. __eou__ Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right __eou__ If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?" __eou__ Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre. __eou__ So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction. __eou__ My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement __eou__ 
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs? __eou__ Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42 __eou__ Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. . __eou__ 
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they? __eou__ Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name. __eou__ They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD __eou__ 
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth. __eou__ I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu. __eou__ 
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you? __eou__ My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value. __eou__ 
You intended to bring your reserves across the river? __eou__ I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left. __eou__ Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust __eou__ 
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir? __eou__ I'm explaining my reasons. __eou__ 
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly? __eou__ And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40 __eou__ 
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle. __eou__ But will they make good use of them? __eou__ 
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called? __eou__ Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard". __eou__ Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not? __eou__ 
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi. __eou__ Thank you. __eou__ 
Yes? __eou__ A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk. __eou__ 
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately. __eou__ Certainly, Sin __eou__ 
Stuart? __eou__ Yes. __eou__ How quickly can you move your artillery forward? __eou__ Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while. __eou__ Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. . __eou__ Right.  Bombardier, to me please. __eou__ 
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse. __eou__ Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command. __eou__ Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work. __eou__ 
Do you think she might be interested in  someone? __eou__ Which one? __eou__ Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me. __eou__ ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye. __eou__ 
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55 __eou__ Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it __eou__ 
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers? __eou__ Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot __eou__ 
Your orders, Mr Vereker? __eou__ I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river __eou__ Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos. __eou__ I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve. __eou__ 
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45 __eou__ And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen? __eou__ So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.  __eou__
